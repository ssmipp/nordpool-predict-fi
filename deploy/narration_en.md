The Olkiluoto 2 nuclear power plant is currently undergoing maintenance. The outage began on 25 May 2025 at 18:00 and is expected to end on 25 June 2025 at 18:00. This maintenance outage may affect forecast accuracy, as training data from outage periods is limited.

In the coming days, electricity prices on the exchange market will experience substantial fluctuations. Price expectations vary throughout the week, with **Saturday** particularly standing out due to its highest anticipated prices. Saturday's average price is expected to be 7.2 cents per kilowatt-hour, and hourly price peaks may exceed 15 ¬¢. The highest prices on Saturday are expected in the morning hours between 07:00 and 09:00, when electricity unit prices may momentarily rise significantly above the daily average. The risk of price spikes on Saturday is high during certain hours.

On **Friday**, electricity prices will also fluctuate significantly. Throughout most of Friday, electricity will remain affordable, but in the evening between 19:00 and 21:00, prices will climb above 10 cents. Friday's highest expected price is 11.4 ¬¢. The risk of price spikes on Friday is notable, occurring mainly during evening hours.

On **Monday**, electricity prices will remain exceptionally low throughout the entire day. Monday's average price will be only around one cent per kilowatt-hour, and the highest single-hour price will remain well below three cents. High wind power generation exceeding 3,000 megawatts partly explains Monday's extraordinarily low prices.

On **Tuesday** and **Thursday**, prices will settle at moderate levels, though there is potential for price spikes during individual hours. On Tuesday evening between 19:00 and 21:00, electricity prices may rise above nine cents, indicating an increased risk of price spikes. On Thursday, the price level will be relatively stable, but certain hours may still approach nearly ten cents.

**Wednesday** will see the lowest single-hour price of the week, just 0.1 cents per kilowatt-hour, occurring in the morning between 05:00 and 07:00. Prices throughout the day remain low overall, though moderate price increases may occur during evening hours.
