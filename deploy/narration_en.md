The outlook for electricity exchange prices will vary considerably in the coming days. In particular, **Wednesday** stands out with its high average price, expected to be 13.7 cents per kilowatt-hour. Price fluctuations throughout the day will be significant, with notably high individual hourly prices anticipated.

On Wednesday morning between 8 and 10, prices are expected to rise above 26 cents, and the day's highest price of 27.3 cents will occur between 9 and 11. The risk of price spikes during individual hours is high, as wind power production will drop to slightly above 100 MW at its lowest. Additionally, prices in the evening from 18 to 22 will remain relatively high, exceeding 16 cents per kilowatt-hour at times.

Starting from Thursday, prices will decrease significantly, with daily average prices remaining at just a few cents per kilowatt-hour. On **Thursday**, electricity will be very affordable, and during the night and early morning hours, prices will even fall below one cent. Thursday's average price will be 2.2 cents, with the day's highest price of 5.3 cents occurring between 9 and 11 in the morning.

The week's lowest hourly prices are expected on **Saturday**, when electricity prices will drop into the negative range at times. The lowest predicted price on Saturday is -1.6 cents per kilowatt-hour between 10 and 12. The day's average price will be extremely low, around half a cent per kilowatt-hour, although there remains a risk of individual hourly price spikes.

After the weekend, prices will rise slightly. The average price on **Sunday** will be moderate, around 3.4 cents per kilowatt-hour. On **Monday** and **Tuesday**, prices will remain reasonable, slightly above three and four cents respectively. However, the risk of individual hourly price spikes will exist for both days.
