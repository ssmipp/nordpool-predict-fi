Olkiluoto 2 nuclear power plant is currently undergoing maintenance, which began on 25 May 2025 at 18:00 and is expected to last until 15 June 2025 at 18:00. The maintenance outage may affect forecast accuracy, as training data during maintenance periods is limited.

Electricity prices will show considerable variation in coming days. Early-week prices will remain moderate, but fluctuations will become significant towards the weekend. The most affordable days will be **Saturday** and **Sunday**, when the average price is below two cents. Negative prices will also occur on both days, dropping as low as -1,5 cents on Saturday and Sunday.

In the early part of the week, **Wednesday** and **Thursday**, prices will remain stable and moderate, averaging slightly above two cents. On both days, the lowest prices will be close to zero cents early in the morning hours. On Thursday, strong wind power production will keep prices low throughout the day.

Price peaks for the week will occur on **Friday** and next **Tuesday**, with both days expected to see individual hourly prices reaching as high as 11,5 cents. The price spike on Friday will occur in the morning hours between 8‚Äì10, coinciding with the lowest wind power production. On Tuesday, the most expensive hours will be in the evening between 20‚Äì22, when wind power production will also be low.

Prices will also rise somewhat on **Monday**, averaging 4,8 cents. However, price fluctuations will be more moderate compared to Friday and Tuesday, and the highest prices will remain under ten cents.

Throughout the week, there will therefore be both very affordable and some individually expensive hours. Price variations will be clearly driven by fluctuations in wind power production. The weekend's public holiday on **Sunday** will somewhat lower prices, although occasional price spikes may still occur.
