The Olkiluoto 2 nuclear power plant is currently undergoing maintenance. The maintenance started on 25 May 2025 at 18:00 and is expected to end on 15 June 2025 at 18:00. This maintenance period may affect the accuracy of the price forecast, as there is limited historical data available during maintenance periods.

Electricity prices will vary considerably in the coming days. On **Friday**, the average price will be clearly the highest of the week, almost five cents per kilowatt-hour. During individual hours, prices may rise close to eleven cents. The risk of price spikes will occur around 8-10 in the morning, when electricity prices reach their peak.

The most affordable day of the week will be **Sunday**, when the average electricity price is forecasted to be negative, at -0.5 cents. Throughout almost the entire day, electricity prices will be around zero or clearly negative, dropping as low as -1.4 cents.

On **Saturday** and **Monday**, prices will also remain low, averaging around one cent per kilowatt-hour. On **Saturday**, however, price fluctuations will be larger, with the morning hours being the most expensive, briefly rising above four cents. On Saturday afternoon, small negative prices will also be observed.

On **Tuesday** and **Thursday**, electricity prices will be very stable, remaining close to zero. On **Wednesday**, price variations will be slightly greater, but the day's average price will still remain clearly under one cent.
