The Olkiluoto 2 nuclear power plant is currently undergoing maintenance, which started on 25.5.2025 at 18:00 and is expected to end on 15.6.2025 at 18:00. The maintenance outage may affect the accuracy of price forecasts, as training data during maintenance periods is limited.

Price forecasts for electricity exchange show considerable variation over the coming days. The week's lowest average price will occur on **Tuesday**, with the daily average even dipping slightly negative, to -0.2 cents. At its lowest, the price will reach -1.3 cents around 16:00. Negative prices indicate excess supply compared to demand.

On **Wednesday**, the average price will rise slightly to 1.4 cents. However, price fluctuations remain moderate, and the day's highest price will reach just four cents. As the week progresses, electricity prices and wind power production will experience significant fluctuations.

**Thursday** will be a public holiday, potentially lowering energy demand and thus reducing price levels. The average price will settle at 2.8 cents/kWh, but certain hours in the morning and evening may exceed four cents. A risk of price spikes exists for individual hours on Thursday.

On **Friday**, electricity prices will continue to rise, and the week's highest hourly price is expected: around 9:00 in the morning, prices could climb above ten cents. Nevertheless, the daily average remains reasonable at 2.9 cents, not significantly different from Thursday's level. A risk of occasional hourly price spikes also exists on Friday.

Over the weekend, prices will decrease again. On **Saturday** and **Sunday**, average prices will remain below two cents, and peak prices will not exceed four cents. On Saturday, the lowest price will again dip negative, reaching -1.0 cents around 2:00 at night. Individual hours during the weekend carry a risk of price spikes, although overall price levels remain moderate.

Next **Monday**, average prices will increase again, reaching the week's highest average at 4.2 cents. Significant hourly variation will occur: around 9:00 in the morning, prices may rise above ten cents, marking the week's second highest hourly rate.
