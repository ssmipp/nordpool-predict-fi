The Olkiluoto 2 nuclear power plant is undergoing maintenance, which started on 25 May 2025 at 18:00 and is expected to end on 21 June 2025 at 18:00. This maintenance break may affect the accuracy of the price forecast, as only limited training data is available during maintenance periods.

Electricity market prices will vary considerably in the coming days. The highest hourly prices of the week will occur on **Friday**, when the risk of price spikes is high. On Friday around 20:00, electricity prices may rise above 15 cents. This is linked to low wind power production, which at that time will fall below 500 MW. Otherwise, Friday's price will be variable, and the cheapest electricity of the day will occur between 03:00 and 05:00 in the early morning, with negative prices.

The weekend will also offer price fluctuations. On **Saturday** and **Sunday**, prices will generally remain low, but occasional price spikes may occur. On Saturday, electricity will be cheapest around 14:00, when the price drops below zero. The most expensive electricity will occur very early on Saturday morning, when the price will rise slightly above four cents.

The beginning of the week will again be somewhat more expensive. On **Monday**, prices will increase particularly in the morning and evening, with the maximum price approaching 10 cents. However, the average price will remain around four cents, making the day not particularly expensive. On **Tuesday** and **Wednesday**, prices will again decrease. On these days, average prices will remain below two cents, with prices occasionally dipping into negative territory.

Overall, the coming week will feature considerable variation in electricity prices. Negative prices in the early-morning and afternoon hours highlight the price volatility. The risk of price spikes will be most significant on **Friday**, but individual higher-priced hours may also appear on other days. Consumers will find the cheapest electricity generally during nighttime or afternoon periods, when prices occasionally even become negative.
