Electricity market prices will fluctuate notably during the forecast period. Prices are expected to remain mostly affordable, but significant price spikes are forecasted for Thursday and Friday.

The week's most expensive days will clearly be **Thursday** and **Friday**, when the average price of electricity hovers slightly below six cents. On both days, wind power production will be limited, averaging just slightly above 500 MW. This partly explains the high maximum prices, which may reach up to 12.6 cents on Thursday and as high as 18 cents on Friday. On these days, prices will peak particularly in the morning hours between 8:00 and 10:00, when demand increases and wind production is lowest.

The most affordable electricity prices of the week will be seen on **Sunday**, when the price will even drop into negative territory. Sunday's average price will be -0.1 cents, and throughout the day prices remain extremely low, reaching their lowest point of -0.8 cents during the morning hours.

Average electricity prices on **Wednesday**, **Saturday**, and **Tuesday** will also remain very moderate, hovering around or below one cent. Saturday's price will be slightly higher than Sunday's but still very affordable at 0.7 cents. On these days, abundant wind power availability keeps electricity prices low.

On **Monday**, electricity prices will rise slightly from the weekend's low levels, but remain affordable at an average of 2.1 cents. The day's peak price of 8.6 cents will occur during the morning hours, between 8:00 and 10:00.

Based on the price forecast, electricity users should prepare for potential price spikes especially on Thursday and Friday mornings. At other times, electricity prices will mostly remain affordable.
