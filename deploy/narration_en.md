Average electricity prices for the coming week will remain extremely low, hovering around zero or slightly above. The most notable days are **Thursday** and **Friday**, when intraday price fluctuations will be significantly larger than on other days. The forecasted average price for Thursday is 2.1 cents, and for Friday, 1.6 cents. On both days, there is a risk of short-term price spikes during certain hours.

On **Thursday**, electricity prices will peak at 4.1 cents between 17:00â€“19:00. **Friday** will also experience similar price surges, especially in the morning hours between 8:00â€“10:00, when prices may rise up to 4.3 cents. On both these days, wind power production will be lower compared to other days, partly explaining these higher maximum prices.

The early part of the week, particularly **Monday** and **Tuesday**, will offer very affordable prices. On **Monday**, prices will remain near zero throughout the day, with even the highest hourly price staying below half a cent. On **Tuesday**, prices will dip into negative territory for several hours, hitting a low of -1.0 cents. Negative prices will also continue during the early hours of **Wednesday**, as well as on **Saturday** and **Sunday**, dropping as low as -1.3 cents.

Weekend days will remain relatively calm regarding price forecasts, although individual short-lived price spikes might occur. Particularly on **Saturday** evening between 18:00â€“20:00, prices may momentarily rise to their daily peak, even though the average daily price will remain low.

Overall, electricity price expectations for the coming week will remain consumer-friendly. Brief price peaks will primarily appear Thursday and Friday; otherwise, the general outlook for the week remains affordable.
