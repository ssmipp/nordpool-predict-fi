Olkiluoto 2 nuclear power plant is currently undergoing a maintenance outage. The outage started on 25 May 2025 at 18:00 and is expected to end on 23 June 2025 at 18:00. The maintenance outage may affect the accuracy of the price forecast, as training data during outages is limited.

In the coming week, electricity prices will vary significantly from day to day. The lowest average prices will occur on **Friday**, when the daily average will drop to 1.1 cents per kilowatt-hour and the lowest hourly price will even dip negative. Particularly inexpensive electricity will be available at night and early morning between 03:00‚Äì07:00.

On **Sunday**, electricity will be the week's most expensive on average, at 5.5 cents per kilowatt-hour. During Sunday morning between 08:00‚Äì10:00, hourly prices will exceed 10 cents. At the same time, Sunday will be the calmest day regarding wind power, which partly explains the higher electricity price.

The lowest individual hourly prices will occur on **Saturday** afternoon between 15:00‚Äì17:00, when prices will even drop slightly negative. Negative prices indicate that electricity producers have to pay to offload excess electricity, reflecting momentary oversupply compared to demand.

On **Monday** and **Tuesday**, electricity will remain inexpensive, below two cents on average. On both days, wind power generation will be at a high level, helping to keep prices low. On Tuesday, price fluctuation will be modest, and no significant price spikes are expected.

On **Thursday**, the average electricity price will rise above four cents again. Daily price peaks will occur mid-morning between 08:00‚Äì10:00, when prices will approach nine cents. Thursday's relatively low minimum wind power production may explain the higher peak price.

Weekly price variations emphasize the importance of balancing electricity production and consumption in pricing. Consumers are advised to monitor price forecasts especially during the weekend and Thursday morning, when prices will be at their highest.
