Electricity exchange prices will show clear variations in the coming days. **Wednesday** will experience the week's highest prices, with an expected average price of 15.5 cents and a maximum price reaching over 32 cents. The highest price peaks are expected to occur in the morning between 9:00 and 11:00, when wind power generation will fall clearly below 100 megawatts. During these hours, actual prices could rise even higher than forecasted.

On **Thursday**, prices will decrease significantly compared to the previous day. The average price for the day is predicted at slightly over two cents. However, it is worth noting a risk of hourly price spikes, especially between 8:00 and 10:00 in the morning. Wind power generation will be at a high level on Thursday, and sudden fluctuations may cause unexpected price peaks.

During **Friday** and the weekend, overall prices will remain low. **Friday's** average price will be just above two cents per kilowatt-hour. On **Saturday**, negative prices are even expected during nighttime and early morning hours, with the lowest price being -1.5 cents. Practically, this means electricity producers will need to pay for feeding electricity into the grid. Saturday will thus be the cheapest day of the week, with an average price of only 0.2 cents.

On **Sunday**, prices will remain moderate, although there is potential for brief price spikes. Sunday's average price will nevertheless rise only slightly below three cents. After the weekend, prices will rise somewhat on **Monday**, when the average price will approach five cents. On Monday, too, there is a risk of hourly price spikes, especially between 8:00 and 10:00 in the morning and between 18:00 and 20:00 in the evening.

On **Tuesday**, prices will stabilize again slightly, with an average price around three cents. Individual higher-priced hours may occur, particularly in the morning hours between 8:00 and 10:00.
