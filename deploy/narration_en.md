The electricity price forecasts for the upcoming week will show some daily variation. On average, prices will remain low, but significant price increases may occur during individual hours.

The week's highest average price will occur on **Wednesday**, averaging 3.7 cents per kilowatt-hour. Within Wednesday, prices will fluctuate notably, with morning hours between 8:00 and 10:00 expected to reach prices over 15 cents. These morning hours will have an increased risk of price spikes.

Prices will also rise temporarily on **Tuesday**, especially between 8:00 and 10:00 in the morning. During these hours, highest prices will approach nearly eight cents. On Thursday and during the weekend, electricity prices will remain lower, with **Thursday** seeing the week's lowest prices, averaging less than one cent per kilowatt-hour. Thursday's low price level is partly explained by higher wind power generation.

The week's price variation will also be influenced by public holidays, which fall on **Friday** and **Saturday**. On these days, electricity demand may be lower than on regular weekdays, potentially contributing to lower price levels. Nevertheless, there remains a risk of temporary price increases during individual hours.

Negative electricity hourly prices will occur on several days, especially at night and early mornings. Prices will drop as low as -1.4 cents per hour during the night leading into **Thursday**, between 2:00 and 4:00. On Sunday afternoon between 14:00 and 16:00, prices will also dip slightly below zero.

Currently, nuclear power generation is reduced due to a maintenance outage at the Olkiluoto 2 nuclear plant. The maintenance started on 25 May 2025 at 18:00 and is expected to continue until 21 June 2025 at 18:00. This outage may affect the accuracy of the forecast, as training data during maintenance periods is limited.
