*Next week's electricity prices will show significant daily variations: the weekend will offer exceptionally low, even negative prices, while Sunday and Thursday will see notably higher rates. The risk of price spikes will be particularly pronounced during periods of low wind power production.*

The Olkiluoto 2 nuclear power plant is undergoing a maintenance outage, which began on 25 May 2025 at 18:00 and is estimated to end on 23 June 2025 at 18:00. This outage may affect the accuracy of the price forecast, as training data during such outages is limited.

Forecast updated on Friday at 14:24.

Next week's electricity price forecasts will vary considerably from day to day. The lowest prices will occur on **Saturday**, when the daily average will stay around 0.4 cents. During Saturday afternoon, electricity prices will even turn negative for a while, reaching as low as -1.3 cents between 13:00–15:00.

In contrast, **Sunday** will have the week's highest daily average price, approximately 4.6 cents. Prices will start rising from 9:00 in the morning, peaking between 19:00–21:00 at a maximum of 9.2 cents. Sunday's price spikes are partly due to exceptionally low wind power generation, with a minimum production level of just 309 MW.

Among weekdays, **Thursday** will stand out as slightly more expensive, with an average price of 3.9 cents and the highest hourly prices occurring in the morning between 8:00–10:00. Thursday's maximum price will reach 8.6 cents—second highest for the week. Again, lower wind power generation (minimum 1327 MW) on Thursday may partially explain this higher price.

Other weekdays will generally maintain moderate pricing levels. **Monday** and **Friday** will be particularly affordable, with average prices below two cents. Price variations on these days will be relatively small, although Friday will also see brief negative prices during early morning hours.

Overall, the week's lowest prices will clearly be on **Saturday**, while the highest hourly rates will occur on **Sunday** and **Thursday**. The risk of price spikes exists every day from Sunday through Friday. Individual peak price hours are most likely to occur during morning and evening consumption peaks.
