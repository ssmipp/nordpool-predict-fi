Electricity prices will vary notably in the coming days. The cheapest days will occur during the weekend, especially on **Saturday** and **Sunday**, when average prices will remain very low. Saturday's average price will be only 0.4 cents per kilowatt hour, and Sunday even lower, at 0.2 cents. On both days, electricity prices will even dip into negative territory during certain night and afternoon hours. On Sunday, the lowest expected price will be -2.9 ¢ between 14:00 and 16:00.

After the weekend, electricity prices will increase. **Monday** and **Tuesday** will clearly stand out with higher prices. Monday's average will be 5.1 cents, and Tuesday's 4.9 cents. Both days will experience significant price variations: Monday's highest price spike of 10.1 ¢ will occur in the morning between 08:00 and 10:00, while Tuesday's peak of 11.8 cents is anticipated in the evening between 19:00 and 21:00.

**Friday**, **Wednesday**, and **Thursday** will have fairly moderate prices, with average prices ranging between 2.0 and 2.7 cents. On these days, price fluctuations will remain moderate, with peaks staying below eight cents. However, Friday will see some individual price spikes in the morning, reaching up to 6.3 cents between 08:00 and 10:00.

Wind power generation will vary throughout the week. Monday will have the lowest average wind power production, which may partly explain higher prices on that day. On other days, wind power generation will remain moderate and will not notably influence electricity prices.

Overall, the week's price development will be divided: the weekend will offer very affordable electricity hours, while weekdays at the beginning of the week will see clearly rising electricity prices. From consumers' perspective, the negative prices during the weekend might be particularly interesting, whereas the price spikes early in the week may reflect on electricity bills.
