During the upcoming week, electricity exchange prices will vary considerably from day to day. Nevertheless, average prices will remain relatively affordable, ranging between 0.2 and 3.8 cents per kilowatt hour. Negative prices will occur overnight on Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday, during which electricity prices may temporarily drop below zero.

The clearly cheapest day of the week will be **Tuesday**, when the average price will settle at just 0.2 cents per kilowatt hour. Prices will remain very low throughout the day on Tuesday, not exceeding one cent at any point. The lowest price will occur around 16:00 in the afternoon, hitting -0.1 cents.

Average prices will rise slightly on Wednesday and Thursday, with greater variation compared to Tuesday. **Thursday** is a public holiday, which may reduce energy demand and thus lower prices. Despite this, prices on Thursday may temporarily rise to as high as 5.6 cents between 8:00 and 10:00 in the morning. The minimal wind power production of only 845 MW on Thursday might partly explain this peak price.

However, the highest price peaks of the week will occur on **Friday**, when electricity prices may temporarily surge up to 10 cents between 9:00 and 11:00. Friday also has the highest average price of the week at 3.8 cents. High peaks will also occur next **Monday**, when electricity prices may reach 11.3 cents during the morning hours between 9:00 and 11:00. These temporary price increases are partly related to the low minimum wind power production on these days.

During the weekend, prices will remain fairly moderate, with Saturday's average at 1.7 cents and Sunday's at 2.0 cents. Nevertheless, both days carry the possibility of temporary price peaks, especially Saturday evening between 18:00 and 20:00, and Sunday morning between 8:00 and 10:00.
