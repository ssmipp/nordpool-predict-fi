The Olkiluoto 2 nuclear power plant is currently undergoing maintenance, which started on 25.5.2025 at 18:00 and is expected to finish on 25.6.2025 at 18:00. The maintenance break may affect the accuracy of the price forecast, as training data from maintenance periods is limited.

Electricity prices in the upcoming period will generally remain affordable, although daily variations will be noticeable. Particularly **Saturday** and **Friday** stand out, with higher maximum prices projected.

On **Thursday**, average electricity prices will remain moderate, slightly above one cent. The day's lowest prices will reach negative levels in the early morning hours, while the most expensive hours will occur between 8:00 and 10:00 in the morning, reaching above three cents.

**Friday** is a public holiday, which may reduce electricity demand and potentially lower prices. Despite this, Friday's forecast highlights a noticeable price spike around 8:00 in the morning, when the electricity price could rise to nearly ten cents. The day's lowest price is slightly negative between 2:00 and 3:00 in the early morning.

The week's highest single-hour price is likely to occur on **Saturday** around 8:00 in the morning. Saturday morningâ€™s price expectation is nearly 15 cents per kilowatt-hour. The risk of price spikes is high on Saturday during individual hours. The high morning price on Saturday is explained by exceptionally low wind power production at that time, dropping slightly above 200 MW. However, the day's average price will remain moderate, at approximately 1.6 cents.

**Sunday** clearly stands out as the week's most affordable day. Average prices will be slightly negative, and prices will remain consistently low throughout the day without significant fluctuations. On Sunday, electricity prices should hardly exceed one cent.

At the start of next week, on **Monday**, the average electricity price remains very reasonable, around one and a half cents. On **Tuesday**, the average price level will rise slightly above three cents, and there will again be a risk of price spikes during individual hours. On Wednesday, electricity prices will return to slightly above one cent, without significant price fluctuations.
