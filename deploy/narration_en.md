*The electricity market price forecast for the coming days is mostly affordable, but individual price spikes will occur over the weekend due to low wind power generation; prices will decrease notably as next week progresses, and on Friday prices will even turn negative thanks to strong wind power production.*

The Olkiluoto 2 nuclear power plant is currently undergoing maintenance. The outage began on 25.5.2025 at 18:00 and is estimated to end on 23.6.2025 at 18:00. This maintenance break may affect the accuracy of the forecast, as training data from maintenance periods is limited.

The forecast was updated on Friday at 09:05.

Over the upcoming week, electricity market prices will exhibit variation. Price expectations will generally remain affordable. However, notable differences between days will occur, both in terms of prices and wind power generation.

The week's highest hourly price spike is expected on **Saturday** morning between 8:00 and 10:00, potentially exceeding 11 cents. Saturday's expected average price will be 4,7 cents per kilowatt-hour. The reason behind the price fluctuations is the low wind power generation during Saturday morning hours.

Individual price peaks are also predicted for **Sunday**, especially between 7:00 and 9:00 in the morning, when prices could exceed ten cents. Sunday's average price expectation is among the highest of the week at 5,7 cents per kilowatt-hour. The price increase will be driven by Sunday's very low minimum wind power production, which will drop as low as 307 MW.

At the beginning of next week, prices will clearly decrease. On **Monday** and **Tuesday**, average prices will remain below two cents, and no price spikes are anticipated for Tuesday. Price variations on Tuesday will be minor, and the lowest hourly price of the day will approach zero.

On **Wednesday** and **Thursday**, the price level will rise slightly compared to early-week prices, but will remain moderate. On Wednesday, negative hourly prices will also occur early in the morning between 2:00 and 4:00. On Thursday morning between 8:00 and 10:00, momentary price spikes could again occur, raising prices above eight cents per kilowatt-hour.

The most affordable day of the week will be **Friday**, when the average price will fall to just half a cent. Friday will feature several negative hourly prices in early morning and afternoon hours. This extremely low price level is related to abundant wind power production, as Friday‚Äôs wind power generation will momentarily exceed even the 3200 MW level.
