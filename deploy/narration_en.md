The Olkiluoto 2 nuclear power plant is currently undergoing a maintenance break. The outage began on 25.5.2025 at 18:00 and is expected to end on 23.6.2025 at 18:00. The maintenance break may affect the accuracy of the forecast, as training data from periods with outages is limited.

Electricity price forecasts for the upcoming week indicate significant daily variation. The week begins on **Monday** with affordable prices, averaging just 0.3 cents per kilowatt-hour. The lowest rates on Monday occur between 02:00 and 05:00 in the early morning, when electricity is practically free.

On **Tuesday**, prices will rise notably compared to Monday, with a daily average of 1.7 cents. The day's price fluctuations will be considerable: electricity is negatively priced early morning between 02:00 and 03:00, while in the evening between 18:00 and 20:00, rates peak slightly over five cents. Tuesday's highest hourly prices might exceed the forecast due to risks of isolated price spikes.

**Thursday** will be the week's most expensive day on average, with electricity costing about 2.7 cents per kilowatt-hour. Prices on Thursday range from 0.4 cents to nearly six cents. The highest prices will occur during the morning hours between 08:00 and 10:00. Similarly, Thursday carries a risk of isolated hourly price spikes possibly surpassing the forecast.

On **Friday** and **Saturday**, electricity will again become significantly cheaper, with average prices hovering around one cent or even zero. On **Sunday**, the average price turns negative, at -0.5 cents, meaning consumers on average will be slightly compensated for electricity usage. Sunday's lowest price will be reached in the afternoon between 13:00 and 14:00, with electricity rates as low as -1.4 cents per kilowatt-hour.

Thus, the week's electricity pricing is characterized by considerable variation between days. Clearly, the cheapest periods are during nighttime and early morning hours, as well as Sunday afternoon. Conversely, the highest prices will concentrate on Tuesday and Thursday mornings and early evenings.
