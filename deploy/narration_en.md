*The electricity price forecast for the coming days shows significant fluctuations: prices will be extremely low, even negative, during the weekend, whereas on Thursday and Friday, prices during certain hours may rise above ten cents due to low wind power production.*

The Olkiluoto 2 nuclear power plant is currently undergoing maintenance. The maintenance outage began on 25 May 2025 at 18:00 and is estimated to end on 15 June 2025 at 18:00. The outage may affect the accuracy of the price forecast, as training data during maintenance periods is limited.

The price forecast for the coming week shows clear daily differences, both in average electricity prices and in the extent of price fluctuations. The week's price trend is not uniform, with prices varying significantly between days.

The most expensive hours of the week will occur on **Thursday**, when the daily maximum price will reach 12,9 cents. Thursday's average price is clearly higher than other days, at 5,9 cents per kilowatt-hour. This is partly due to weak wind power production, averaging only 925 megawatts. Thursday is also a public holiday, which may generally reduce energy consumption, yet the risk for hourly price spikes remains high. These spikes are particularly expected between about 9:00 and 21:00.

**Friday's** expected maximum price is also high, exceeding 11 cents, although the average price remains moderate at 3,6 cents. Again, the low minimum wind power production of just 271 megawatts explains the risk of price spikes during certain hours. The highest prices are expected between about 8:00 and 10:00 in the morning.

The cheapest days of the week will be during the weekend. On **Saturday**, the average electricity price will remain below one cent, around 0,8 cents, and on **Sunday**, the average price will even be negative (-0,1 cents/kWh). On both days, wind power production will be moderate to fairly abundant on Sunday, keeping prices low. On Sunday, electricity prices will be negative during several nighttime and afternoon hours.

At the beginning and end of the week, prices will remain at moderate levels. On **Wednesday**, the average price is 1,4 cents, and on **Monday** and **Tuesday** prices will stay around one and a half cents. On these days, the price fluctuations will be narrow, and no particular risk of price spikes has been highlighted.
