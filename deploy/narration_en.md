In the coming week, electricity prices will vary considerably day-by-day. At the start of the week, prices will remain moderate or even negative. On **Monday** and **Tuesday**, average prices on the power exchange will be close to zero, with hourly prices reaching slightly more than one cent negative at their lowest. On both days, peak prices will stay below three cents.

On **Wednesday**, the average price will rise slightly, reaching just under one cent per kilowatt-hour. The highest price will occur around eight o'clock in the morning, exceeding three cents. Price fluctuations will be greater than earlier in the week, yet the overall price level will remain moderate.

The weekly price peak will occur on **Friday**, around nine o'clock in the morning. At this time, electricity prices are forecasted to climb above nine cents. Friday's average price, nearly three cents, will stand out clearly from the rest of the week. The higher price level is partly explained by the low minimum production of wind power, which will fall below 1400 megawatts.

A public holiday on **Thursday** may reduce electricity demand, potentially lowering prices. Despite this, Thursday's average price will be around one and a half cents, with peak prices approaching five cents in the evening between 18:00-20:00. Over the weekend, especially on **Saturday**, considerable price fluctuations will continue: the lowest price of the day will even be negative, but prices will rise to around three cents in the evening between 19:00-21:00.

On **Sunday**, the average electricity price will return to slightly negative territory. The day's price range will be narrow and remain low throughout the day.
