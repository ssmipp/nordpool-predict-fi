In the coming week, electricity spot prices will vary significantly from one day to another. However, prices will generally remain at affordable levels, with no particularly high average prices expected. Exceptionally low prices will occur early in the week, whereas the weekend will see individual hours with higher price peaks.

**Monday** stands out as the week's cheapest day. The average price will be only 1,1 cents, with the day's lowest hourly forecast dropping as low as 0,3 ¢. These lowest prices will occur between 03:00–05:00 early in the morning. Also, **Wednesday** will show very affordable electricity prices, with the day's minimum even dipping negative to -0,5 ¢ around 05:00.

Over the weekend, electricity prices will be somewhat higher than earlier in the week. **Sunday** will be the week's most expensive day, with an average price approaching six cents and the day's peak price climbing up to 11,5 ¢ in the morning between 07:00–09:00. Sunday's price peaks can be explained by very low minimum wind power production (315 MW), which pushes electricity prices higher for individual hours.

Within the week, price fluctuations will be large. During the cheapest hours earlier in the week, electricity prices may fall close to zero or even below, while during the weekend some hours can push prices above ten cents. On Saturday, prices are expected to range between 1,0–9,8 ¢, and individual price peaks will also be possible then.

On **Thursday**, the average electricity price will again rise slightly, reaching hourly peaks of 8,4 ¢ during the evening hours around 19:00–21:00. Tuesday and Friday will offer moderately low prices, although Tuesday evening between 19:00–21:00 will see prices rise up to 7,1 cents.

Overall, next week's electricity prices will remain affordable, but consumers should be aware of substantial hourly fluctuations, especially during the weekend and Thursday evening.
