Electricity prices for the coming days will vary noticeably between weekdays. Prices will dip into negative territory several times during the week, especially at night, meaning consumers could occasionally be paid slightly for using electricity. However, the week will also see periods of high price peaks.

The highest prices of the week will occur on **Tuesday**, when the average price will rise to 5.3 cents and the highest hourly price will reach 11.8 cents in the evening between 19:00‚Äì21:00. On Tuesday, wind power production will drop as low as 556 megawatts, partly explaining the higher evening prices.

On **Wednesday** and **Thursday**, prices will be significantly lower. Wednesday's average price will only be 1.9 ¬¢, and Thursday's average will drop even further to just 0.8 cents. Early Thursday morning between midnight and 03:00, electricity prices are expected to be negative, bottoming out at -1.0 cents. These low prices will result from abundant wind power production, which will peak at nearly 4800 megawatts on Thursday.

On **Friday**, the average price will rise slightly again to 2.8 cents. The weekend will also experience price fluctuations. On **Saturday** and **Sunday**, prices will return to negative territory, reaching as low as -1.1 cents on Saturday afternoon between 13:00‚Äì15:00. Nevertheless, weekend averages will remain moderate, with Saturday averaging 1.7 ¬¢ and Sunday 0.7 ¬¢.

Next **Monday**, prices will rise once again. The average price will reach 4.7 cents, peaking at 10.2 cents in the evening between 19:00‚Äì21:00. On Monday, wind power production will average only 1338 megawatts, contributing to the higher prices.

Throughout the week, there will be a risk of short-term price spikes on individual hours, particularly on Tuesday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday, and next Monday. Price peaks will typically occur during evening hours, approximately between 18:00‚Äì20:00.
