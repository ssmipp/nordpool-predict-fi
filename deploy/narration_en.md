The Olkiluoto 2 nuclear power plant is currently undergoing a maintenance break. This outage started on 25.5.2025 at 18:00 and is estimated to end on 15.6.2025 at 18:00. The maintenance break may impact the accuracy of the forecast due to limited training data available during such periods.

Electricity prices will mostly remain low in the coming days, though some variation is anticipated. The lowest average price of the week will occur on **Tuesday**, averaging just 0.2 cents per kilowatt-hour. Prices will even dip slightly negative at several consecutive hours around midday and again late in the evening. On **Wednesday**, prices will continue to be moderate, although the price range widens and will briefly reach three cents.

On **Thursday**, the average electricity price will significantly rise compared to early in the week, reaching 3.4 cents. Thursday is a public holiday, which may reduce electricity consumption, thus influencing prices. However, there will be high hourly prices during the day, causing notable fluctuations. The peak price (7.2 cents) will occur in the evening between 18:00 and 20:00.

On **Friday**, the average price remains at almost the same level as Thursday, but the hourly price variations are considerably larger. The highest hourly price of the entire week, 12 cents, will occur on Friday morning between 8:00 and 10:00. Later in the day, prices will drop significantly, reaching below one cent per kilowatt-hour at their lowest point.

Over the weekend, electricity prices will revert to the low levels seen earlier in the week. The average price on **Saturday** will be 1.4 cents, and on **Sunday**, even lower at just 0.4 cents. Sunday afternoon and evening will see negative prices for several hours. On **Monday**, electricity prices will rise slightly from the weekend but still remain relatively affordable, averaging 1.8 cents per kilowatt-hour.

The negative prices at times during the week, along with moderate averages, reflect a good balance between electricity generation and demand. The highest prices will be concentrated on individual hours on Friday and Thursday, but overall, the week's price level remains affordable.
