The Olkiluoto 2 nuclear power plant is undergoing maintenance from 25 May 2025 at 18:00 until 21 June 2025 at 18:00. This maintenance outage may affect forecast accuracy due to limited available training data from outage periods.

Electricity prices for the coming week will generally remain affordable. Some variation between days will occur, but average prices will mostly stay below four cents. Negative minimum prices will appear on several days, especially during nighttime hours.

The week's highest hourly prices will occur on **Wednesday**, when prices could temporarily rise to over 16 cents between 8:00 and 10:00 in the morning. Wind power production will drop to a very low level at this time, partially explaining these price spikes. Wednesday will also have the week's highest average price of approximately 3.6 ¢/kWh.

On **Tuesday** morning between 8:00 and 10:00, prices will also rise notably, with the peak approaching nine cents. Otherwise, Tuesday is expected to remain relatively stable. In contrast, **Thursday** prices will stay very low throughout the day, with even the highest hourly price barely exceeding two cents.

**Friday** is a public holiday, which may reduce electricity demand and help keep prices moderate. Friday's highest hourly price will be around seven cents, but the average will remain modest at 1.4 cents.

Weekend prices will be slightly higher than the week's cheapest days but will still remain moderate. On **Saturday**, prices could rise up to around nine cents in the morning, but the average will stay around 3.3 cents. **Sunday** prices will again be slightly more moderate, peaking just above five cents.

Overall, electricity prices during the week will fluctuate somewhat but no major surprises are expected. Negative nighttime prices may provide savings opportunities for those able to shift their electricity usage to night hours.
