The forecast for electricity prices on the power exchange shows variation in the coming days. Price levels will remain generally low, below three cents on average for most days. However, the weekend will see occasional higher-priced hours, causing hourly prices to rise temporarily.

The highest single-hour rate of the week will occur on **Friday**, when between 19:00 and 21:00 the price is expected to reach ten cents. Despite the holidays on Friday and **Saturday**, which may reduce overall energy demand, both days will carry a risk of high prices, especially in evening hours. On Saturday, the highest price will occur in the morning between 08:00 and 10:00, reaching up to 9,6 ¬¢.

The cheapest hours clearly occur overnight during the weekend and early next week. **Sunday** will deliver the lowest price of the week, with overnight electricity prices dropping into negative territory, down to -1,1 cents at their lowest. Negative prices will also appear during night hours on **Monday** and **Wednesday**, dipping as low as -0,5 ¬¢.

Wind power variability partly explains the week's price fluctuations. On Friday and Saturday, minimum wind power production will fall below 1000 MW, contributing to higher hourly price peaks. On Sunday and Monday, wind power production will be abundant, reflected in the notably low average prices.

On Tuesday, prices will again slightly rise, with an average price settling at around 2,9 ¬¢. Tuesday has also been identified as a day with a risk of price spikes, likely occurring during morning or evening hours. Wednesday and Thursday similarly carry a risk of occasional price increases, although average prices on both days will remain moderate.

Overall, electricity prices in the upcoming days will fluctuate, but average prices will stay affordably low. However, consumers should prepare for some brief hourly price spikes, particularly on Friday and Saturday.
