The Olkiluoto 2 nuclear power plant is currently undergoing maintenance. The outage began on 25 May 2025 at 18:00 and is expected to end on 15 June 2025 at 18:00. This maintenance outage may affect forecast accuracy, as training data during such outages is limited.

Electricity prices will vary significantly throughout the upcoming week, both between days and within daily hours. Prices will reach their peak early in the week, particularly on **Tuesday** and Wednesday. On Tuesday, the daily average price will exceed nine cents, with specific hourly rates potentially reaching over 20 cents. Particularly high prices are expected in the evening between 19:00â€“21:00, when the risk of price spikes is substantial.

On **Wednesday**, the average daily price will be the week's highest at 11.5 cents. Peak hourly prices could climb exceptionally high, possibly surpassing 26 cents during morning hours between 8:00â€“10:00. Wednesday's price peaks relate to very weak wind power production, as wind generation will be exceptionally low throughout the day, reaching a minimum of just over 100 megawatts.

On Thursday and Friday, electricity prices will drop considerably compared to the early week. On **Thursday**, the average price will fall to about two cents, and overnight hours may even experience negative prices. On **Friday**, the situation will become even more affordable, with an average price hovering around one and a half cents.

During the weekend, electricity prices will stay moderate but somewhat variable. On **Saturday**, the daily average will be only 1.3 Â¢, but some isolated price spikes may occur in the evening between 19:00â€“21:00. The price will rise slightly on **Sunday**, with an expected daily average of 3.5 Â¢.

Next **Monday**, prices will increase slightly compared to the weekend, with an average around 4.6 cents. Occasional hourly price spikes may occur, but they will remain clearly below the peak prices seen earlier in the week.
