The Olkiluoto 2 nuclear power plant is undergoing maintenance. The outage began on 25.5.2025 at 18:00 and is expected to end on 15.6.2025 at 18:00. This maintenance outage may affect the accuracy of the price forecast, as training data during such outages is limited.

During the coming week, electricity prices will experience significant daily variations. On **Wednesday**, prices will remain very low, with an average of only 0.3 cents per kilowatt-hour. At night and early morning hours, prices will even dip into negative territory, reaching as low as -0.3 cents.

On **Thursday**, average prices will rise notably, reaching 6.6 cents. Prices will vary greatly throughout the day, with morning hours between 8:00 and 10:00 seeing prices climb above 10 cents. The highest individual predicted price spike will occur between 8:00 and 10:00, potentially rising to 12.4 cents. These spikes are primarily caused by very limited wind power production, dropping as low as 225 MW.

On **Friday**, the price fluctuations will intensify further. The day's average price will be around 4.5 cents, but the highest predicted price spike of the week will occur in the morning between 8:00 and 10:00, possibly reaching as high as 18.5 cents. Again, the reason for these high prices will be the very limited wind power production in the morning, with wind output dropping to as low as 237 MW.

For the weekend, prices will fall significantly. On **Saturday**, the average price will be just 0.2 cents, and at night prices will become negative, dropping as low as -1.1 cents. Short-term price spikes may still occur in the evening between 18:00 and 20:00, when prices might rise above three cents.

On **Sunday**, the average electricity price will remain negative at -0.3 cents. Negative hourly prices will appear again during the day, with the lowest price at -1.3 cents.

Next **Monday** and **Tuesday**, prices will remain moderate. Monday‚Äôs average price will hover around one cent, with Tuesday‚Äôs slightly above one cent. Price variations within these days will be moderate, but isolated price peaks might occur, especially Monday morning between 8:00 and 10:00.
