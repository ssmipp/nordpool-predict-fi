*Electricity prices will fluctuate significantly in the coming days, with Wednesday seeing elevated prices due to low wind power generation, while the weekend will feature even negative pricing; price spikes may occur during individual hours nearly every day, though overall price levels remain mostly moderate.*

In the upcoming days, electricity prices will fluctuate significantly. **Wednesday** will clearly be the most expensive day, with an average price rising to 15.5 cents and peak prices potentially reaching up to 32.4 cents. The highest prices will occur in the morning between 9:00 and 11:00, when wind power production is forecasted to be extremely low, below 100 MW. This low wind-power production explains Wednesday's high peak prices and significantly raises the day's average price.

On **Thursday**, prices will clearly drop from Wednesday, with the average price being only 2.7 cents. Wind power generation will strengthen considerably, contributing to lower price levels. However, there remains a risk of individual price spikes on Thursday, even though the day's overall price level will stay low.

From Friday through the weekend, electricity prices will remain generally very affordable. Friday's average price is set at 3.0 cents, and negative prices are even expected in the early morning hours around 3:00â€“5:00. However, there is still a risk of price spikes on Friday. On **Saturday**, prices will fall even further, with an average price of only 0.2 cents. Saturday will also see the week's lowest hourly price, -1.6 cents, around midday between 13:00 and 15:00.

From Sunday to Tuesday, prices will rise again slightly but still remain affordable on average. Sunday's average price will be 3.3 cents, Monday's 3.8 cents, and Tuesday's 5.2 cents. All these days also have a noted risk of price spikes during individual hours, although overall daily price levels remain moderate.

In summary, the week ahead will see substantial variations in electricity prices. Wednesday clearly stands out as the week's most expensive day, with significant hourly price variations expected. The weekend will bring exceptionally affordable hours for electricity users, including possible negative prices.
