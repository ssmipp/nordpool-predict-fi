In the upcoming week, electricity price forecasts highlight a significant risk of price spikes particularly on **Tuesday**. Tuesday's price variability will be exceptionally large, with prices expected to range between as low as 0.2 cents and as high as 13.1 cents. The most expensive hours of the week will occur Tuesday morning, from 8:00 to 10:00, when the price forecast exceeds 11 cents per kilowatt-hour. Additional price spikes may also occur in the evening hours between 19:00 and 21:00. This high volatility is partly explained by the very low minimum wind power production, dropping below 600 MW during morning hours.

On other days, the weekly average electricity price will remain notably low. The cheapest electricity of the week is expected on **Monday**, with an average daily price of just 0.2 cents. During the night before Monday, prices will momentarily dip below zero, meaning negative electricity prices are forecast during quieter nighttime hours.

Similarly, on **Thursday**, electricity prices remain very low, averaging around 0.6 cents. Thursday's price variation will be moderate, although individual price spikes may occur around 8:00 in the morning.

During the weekend, prices will remain affordable. On **Saturday** and **Sunday**, the lowest weekly prices are anticipated, dropping even below minus one cent. Sunday is a public holiday, when electricity demand might be lower than usual, potentially reducing prices further. Nevertheless, there is also a risk of individual price peaks on Sunday.

Later in the week, especially on **Friday**, electricity will be slightly more expensive, yet the daily average price will still be clearly below three cents. On Friday morning between 8:00 and 10:00, electricity prices will rise above six cents, with individual price spikes possible during these hours.
