*Electricity exchange prices will remain generally affordable in the coming days, but clear fluctuations within the week are anticipated: negative prices are expected over the weekend, while early next week prices will peak up to seven cents during morning hours due to lower wind power generation.*

There is currently an ongoing maintenance outage at the Olkiluoto 2 nuclear power plant. This maintenance began on 25 May 2025 at 18:00 and is expected to end on 15 June 2025 at 18:00. The maintenance outage could affect the accuracy of the price forecast, as training data during maintenance periods is limited.

Forecast updated on Friday at 03:18.

In the coming week, electricity prices are expected to be generally affordable, but daily variations will be significant. The week's lowest price levels are expected on **Saturday**, when the daily average price will dip slightly into negative territory, approximately -0.1 cents per kilowatt-hour. On Saturday, prices will range from a minimum of -1.5 Â¢ to a maximum of 1.5 Â¢. Negative prices will particularly occur during nighttime and morning hours between 03:00 and 16:00.

On **Sunday**, electricity prices will remain low, although a brief spike up to 6.6 cents may occur in the evening between 19:00 and 21:00. Sunday is a public holiday, reducing energy demand and helping to keep the day's average price low, around 0.3 Â¢.

Prices will rise at the start of the week. On **Monday**, the average price will increase to 3.3 cents, with the day's peak price of 7 cents occurring in the morning between approximately 08:00 and 10:00. Monday will have the highest daily average price of the week, partly due to the low minimum wind power production (only 824 MW). This could result in price spikes during individual hours.

On **Tuesday** and **Wednesday**, prices will remain slightly lower than on Monday, yet still around 2â€“3 cents. Tuesday's highest price of 6.2 Â¢ occurs between 08:00â€“10:00 in the morning, while Wednesday's peak of 5.3 cents is also expected around the same time. Price spikes are possible during these days but likely brief.

Later in the week, prices will decline again. On **Thursday**, the daily average price will drop to around one cent, and on **Friday**, it will slightly rise to 1.4 cents. On both days, the risk of price spikes is very low and not particularly noted.
