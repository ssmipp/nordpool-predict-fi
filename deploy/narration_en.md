The Olkiluoto 2 nuclear power plant is currently undergoing maintenance, which started on 25 May 2025 at 18:00 and is expected to end on 21 June 2025 at 18:00. This maintenance outage may affect the accuracy of the price forecast, as there is limited training data available for such periods.

The electricity market for the coming week will be varied. The most expensive day clearly stands out as **Friday**, when the average electricity price is expected to reach 6.0 cents per kilowatt-hour. Price fluctuations will be significant, as the day's lowest price will dip into negative territory (-0.6 ¢) during the early morning hours between 03:00–05:00, but the highest prices will occur in the evening around 19:00–21:00, potentially reaching close to 18 cents. Wind power production on Friday will occasionally be very low, partially explaining the high price peak in the evening.

**Saturday** will be the cheapest day of the week, with an average price of just 0.4 cents. The day's lowest price will be negative (-1.5 ¢), and prices throughout the day will remain low. On **Sunday**, the average electricity price will also stay affordable at around 3 cents, although prices will peak at just over eight cents during the evening hours approximately between 18:00 and 20:00.

Among weekdays, **Monday** and **Tuesday** will be fairly similar to each other. On both days, prices will fluctuate between roughly one cent and above 11 cents, with average prices slightly above four cents. The most expensive hours on Monday and Tuesday will typically occur during morning and evening consumption peaks, when prices may exceed ten cents.

On **Wednesday** and **Thursday**, price levels will clearly fall again. Both days will average only 1.7 cents, with daily minimum prices dipping slightly negative. Fluctuations on these days will remain moderate, and high price spikes are not expected.

The risk of price spikes is noted on several days, especially on **Friday**, when the prices for individual hours may rise higher than forecasted. Such spikes usually occur around peak electricity consumption times in the morning and evening.
