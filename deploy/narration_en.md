Next week's electricity prices will see significant variations between different days and times of day. The cheapest hours will generally occur at night and in the early morning, when prices will even turn negative. These negative-price hours will be present on several days, especially during the weekend. **Sunday's** average price will even be slightly negative (-0.1 Â¢), indicating extremely favorable electricity prices for consumers.

The most noticeable price increases will occur on **Tuesday**, with an average daily price rising to 2.1 cents. Tuesday's peak price is expected between 19:00â€“21:00, reaching 6.5 cents. Risks for price spikes have also been noted for **Thursday**, **Friday**, **Saturday**, and **Sunday**, when individual hourly prices could momentarily climb considerably higher than the daily average.

**Thursday's** average price (2.6 Â¢) will be the highest of the week. The highest peaks on Thursday evening between 19:00â€“21:00 will reach up to 5.2 cents. Thursday's elevated price level can be explained especially by low minimum wind power production (1334 MW), which drives up the maximum price.

Towards the weekend, prices will noticeably decline. On **Saturday** and Sunday, the daily average prices will be the lowest of the entire week, with Saturday's minimum price even dropping as low as -1.0 cents. On Sunday, the electricity price will remain low throughout the entire day, never significantly exceeding one cent.

Overall, next week's electricity prices will remain affordable for consumers, although clear price fluctuations will appear on certain days and hours. Consumers should especially consider the higher evening prices on Tuesday and Thursday.
