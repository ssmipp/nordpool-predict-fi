Next week's electricity prices are expected to vary considerably between different days and hours. The week's highest hourly prices will occur on **Monday**, when prices are forecast to peak at approximately 13.4 cents per kilowatt-hour in the evening between 18:00 and 20:00. Monday's average price, 5.3 cents, will be the highest of the week. It is also notable that the minimum wind power output on Monday is low, partly explaining the day's high peak price. **Wednesday** and **Friday** will also see relatively high peak prices, around nine cents per kilowatt-hour in the morning hours.

The week's lowest prices will occur during nighttime hours and over the weekend. On **Saturday** afternoon, the price will drop as low as -1.8 cents between 14:00 and 16:00. **Sunday** afternoon will also see negative prices, reaching -1.1 cents between 15:00 and 17:00.

Several days during the week carry the risk of sudden hourly price spikes. This risk particularly affects Monday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, and Sunday. On these days, the hourly prices could briefly exceed the forecasted maximum, especially if wind forecasts turn out weaker than anticipated.

Friday and Saturday are public holidays, which may reduce energy demand and thus lower electricity prices. The average prices on these two days will indeed be clearly lower than Monday's, around two cents. Thursday and Sunday will be the cheapest days of the week in terms of average prices, staying around one cent or even below.

Overall, price expectations for the week are volatile, and consumers should be prepared for significant price fluctuations, especially early in the week. The negative prices during the weekend are exceptional, and utilizing these periods may be beneficial for electricity consumers.
