The Olkiluoto 2 nuclear power plant is undergoing maintenance. The outage began on May 25th, 2025 at 18:00 and is expected to end on June 15th, 2025 at 18:00. The plant‚Äôs availability is currently at 0%, meaning its full capacity of 890 MW is out of use. This maintenance outage may affect the accuracy of the price forecast, as training data during outage periods is limited.

According to forecasts, electricity prices will vary noticeably over the coming days. While prices are expected to remain generally low, clear differences between individual days will occur. The most expensive day of the week will be **Thursday**, with an average daily electricity price rising to 5.4 cents per kilowatt-hour. Thursday will also see the week‚Äôs highest hourly price, potentially reaching up to 13.1 cents between approximately 19:00‚Äì21:00. This price spike is significantly influenced by exceptionally low minimum wind power production, only 233 MW.

On **Friday**, prices are also expected to rise temporarily much higher than on other days of the week. Friday's peak hourly price of 9.8 ¬¢ will occur during morning hours, approximately between 08:00‚Äì10:00. Wind power production on Friday is forecast to be low, explaining the price increase.

The cheapest prices of the week will occur during the weekend. On **Saturday** and **Sunday**, average electricity prices will remain below one cent per kilowatt-hour. Negative hourly prices will also occur on these days, mainly during nighttime and early morning hours. Saturday's lowest price is -0.8 ¬¢, and Sunday's lowest is -0.9 ¬¢.

Early in the week, prices will once again be moderate. On **Monday**, the average price is expected to be 1.9 cents, with moderate price variations. On **Tuesday**, the average price will decrease slightly to 1.3 cents, and no significant price peaks are expected.

Overall, the electricity price forecast promises mostly affordable prices, despite a few individual higher peaks. Particular attention should be paid to Thursday's price spike, as it may materialize higher than forecast due to reduced wind production.
