Electricity market prices will vary noticeably in the coming days. The week's highest price spikes are forecasted for **Friday**, when the maximum hourly rate is expected to rise over 17 cents between 19:00 and 21:00. Friday's average price is projected at 5,1 Â¢, slightly higher than on other days.

**Saturday** will likely be the week's cheapest day, with average prices below one cent. On Saturday afternoon between 13:00 and 17:00, prices will be particularly low, dipping into negative territory at -1,6 Â¢ at the lowest. Negative prices around -0,6 Â¢ are also expected early on **Friday** morning from 03:00 to 05:00.

Prices on other days will be more balanced. On **Thursday** and **Monday**, average prices remain moderate, at 3,0 Â¢ and 3,9 Â¢ respectively. Tuesday's average price will be slightly higher at 4,2 cents, with the day's highest hourly price of 13,4 Â¢ occurring in the morning between 08:00 and 10:00.

Midweek on **Wednesday**, the average price will drop below two cents again. Wednesday's hourly prices remain moderate, peaking at 6,5 cents between 08:00 and 10:00 in the morning.

Several days, however, carry a noted risk of price spikes during individual hours. On Friday, Saturday, Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday, such price spikes may occur. Especially during Friday's peak price from 19:00 to 21:00, users should prepare for potentially higher-than-forecasted rates.
