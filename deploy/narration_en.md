Next week's electricity prices will show some variation, but average prices will remain very affordable. The forecasted daily average price will stay well below four cents throughout the week, indicating a low price level.

The most affordable day will be **Sunday**, when the average electricity price is expected to drop even slightly below zero, averaging -0.6 cents per kilowatt-hour. Sunday will also see the week's lowest hourly price at -1.5 cents around 8 in the morning.

**Thursday** stands out as the most expensive day, with an average price of 2.4 cents and a maximum hourly price of 5.6 cents around 20:00 in the evening. Thursday's elevated price level is partly explained by relatively low average wind power generation (1897 MW), especially during the evening hours when prices peak.

**Friday** will also see somewhat higher prices, reaching a maximum of 4.9 cents in the morning around 8:00. Wind power production on Friday will be at the week's lowest average level (1534 MW), contributing to the increased price.

On other days, electricity prices will fluctuate moderately but remain mostly very low. Negative price hours are forecasted for nearly every day, especially during weekend and early-week nights and Sunday morning.

A risk of price spikes is mentioned for each day during specific hours. Users should thus be aware that individual hourly prices might deviate from the forecasted amounts. In particular, Thursday and Friday mornings between 7-9 and evenings between 19-21 are expected to see the highest hourly prices.
