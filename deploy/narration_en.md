The Olkiluoto nuclear plant's unit 2 is undergoing a maintenance break. During this outage, the available capacity is 0 MW, and the plant's availability is at zero percent. The maintenance break started on 25.5.2025 at 18:00, and its estimated end time is 23.6.2025 at 18:00. The maintenance break may affect the accuracy of the forecast, as training data during such outages are limited.

In the coming week, electricity prices will remain relatively low on average. However, price variations between the days will be notable, and occasionally prices will even turn negative.

The most expensive days of the week will be **Thursday** and **Friday**. On both days, the average electricity price will settle at 2.1 cents per kilowatt-hour. On Thursday, the highest prices are expected in the evening around 19:00‚Äì21:00, when the hourly price may rise up to 5.7 cents. Friday evening also sees higher prices, with the highest predicted hourly price at 4.9 cents at 9 in the morning.

**Sunday** is forecasted to be the cheapest day, as the average price will fall slightly below zero, at -0.4 cents. On Sunday, prices will drop as low as -1.3 cents between 13:00‚Äì15:00. Saturday will also experience negative prices at times, hitting a low of -1.2 cents in the afternoon around 13:00‚Äì15:00.

Wind power generation will vary somewhat during the week. Thursday's and Friday's higher prices correlate with relatively lower average wind power generation, which will remain under 2000 MW on those days. On Thursday, wind power will be as low as 1305 MW at minimum, explaining the highest hourly price of that day.

Individual hourly price spikes are possible on Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, and Sunday. These days have significant price ranges, so short-term higher prices might occur particularly during morning or evening hours.
