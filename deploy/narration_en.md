The Olkiluoto 2 nuclear power plant is currently undergoing maintenance. The outage began on 25.5.2025 at 18:00 and is expected to end on 15.6.2025 at 18:00. This maintenance break may affect the accuracy of the forecast, as training data during such outages is limited.

During the upcoming week, the electricity exchange price will exhibit moderate fluctuations. Still, the daily average price will remain affordable throughout the week, mostly below three cents per kilowatt-hour.

The week's lowest prices will occur on **Saturday**, when the daily average electricity price will be negative at -0,5 ¬¢. Throughout Saturday, prices will stay close to zero, with the day's lowest price, -1,2 ¬¢, occurring in the afternoon between 13:00‚Äì15:00. Prices will also briefly dip negative during nighttime on **Monday**, **Wednesday**, **Friday**, and **Sunday**, though daily averages will remain around zero or slightly above.

The most expensive day of the week will be **Tuesday**, when the average electricity price will rise close to three cents (2,9 ¬¢). During Tuesday morning from 07:00‚Äì09:00, prices could momentarily exceed eight cents. This peak can be explained by significantly lower minimum wind power production, dropping to only 425 megawatts in the morning. Risks for hourly price spikes exist also on **Wednesday**, **Thursday**, **Friday**, **Saturday**, and **Sunday**, but they are forecasted to be more moderate compared to Tuesday.

On other days of the week, average prices will remain considerably lower. On **Thursday**, the average price will be 1,2 ¬¢, with the highest price slightly exceeding four cents during the morning hours from 07:00‚Äì09:00. Again, this peak coincides with a temporary drop in wind power production during the morning. The remaining days will generally offer stable prices without significant fluctuations.

At the end of the week, on **Sunday**, electricity demand is expected to be lower than normal due to the holiday, which may keep prices close to zero.
