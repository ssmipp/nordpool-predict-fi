The coming week's electricity price forecast shows day-to-day variation. Prices will generally remain affordable, though certain days will see higher peaks. At the beginning of the week, especially on **Monday** and **Wednesday**, electricity prices will remain very moderate, with daily averages staying around or below two cents. Negative prices will also occur during nighttime or early morning hours on these days.

The week's highest rates are expected on **Thursday**, when the daily average price will rise to five cents, and hourly maximum prices will approach ten cents. The risk of price spikes will especially occur Thursday evening around 19:00â€“21:00, when hourly prices may rise higher than forecasted. Thursday's low minimum wind power production, below two thousand megawatts, partly explains this price increase.

Higher prices are also expected on **Tuesday**, with an average price of 3,5 cents and a maximum price of 8 cents. The risk of price spikes will occur Tuesday evening around 19:00â€“21:00. For Friday and Sunday, price levels will remain moderate, but the risk of price spikes is still present, especially in the evening hours.

The week's cheapest hours will occur during the nights of Monday and Wednesday, when prices will even dip slightly negative. Early Tuesday morning between 02:00â€“04:00 will also see prices close to zero.

During the weekend, electricity prices will remain moderate, but individual price spikes may still occur. Saturday's highest price will remain below five cents, while Sunday's maximum price will exceed seven cents slightly.

Overall, next week's electricity prices will range from affordable to moderate, but individual evenings may experience higher price peaks.
