*Next week’s electricity price forecast shows significant variation: early in the week, prices will spike considerably, particularly during morning peak hours, but towards the end of the week and weekend, electricity will be very affordable, even occasionally negative. Fluctuations in wind power generation will especially influence price variations.*

The Olkiluoto 2 nuclear power plant is currently undergoing maintenance. This maintenance started on 25 May 2025 at 18:00 and is expected to end on 15 June 2025 at 18:00. Such maintenance outages may affect the accuracy of price forecasts due to limited historical data available during these periods.

Price forecast updated on Saturday at 21:05.

Next week's electricity price forecasts vary significantly from day to day. The week will start on **Monday** and **Tuesday** with relatively high average prices. Monday's average price will be 6.5 cents per kilowatt-hour, and Tuesday's will rise slightly further to 7.8 cents. Both days come with a risk of electricity price spikes during individual hours. On Tuesday morning, between approximately 8:00 and 10:00, prices may exceed 17 cents per kilowatt-hour.

On **Wednesday**, prices will decline somewhat, though the daily average will remain at 4.8 cents. Wednesday will also experience noticeable intra-day price differences, ranging from 1.4 to 11.3 cents. This price variability is partly explained by relatively low wind power production, with minimum values just above one thousand megawatts.

Thursday and Friday forecasts promise significantly more affordable electricity. On Thursday, the average price will drop below two cents, and intra-day prices will fluctuate minimally: at its cheapest, electricity will cost only 0.1 cents, and at the highest slightly over four cents. On Friday, prices will remain similarly low, with even negative prices predicted overnight. This means electricity consumers could receive payment for electricity use during these particular hours.

Weekend days will be very affordable. On **Saturday**, the average price will be around one cent, and negative prices are again expected during nighttime hours. **Sunday** will be similar, and it will also be a public holiday, resulting in lower-than-usual electricity consumption. This partially explains Sunday's low prices, typically around one cent or even less per kilowatt-hour.

The week's highest individual hourly prices will occur on Monday and Tuesday mornings, while the cheapest hours will be overnight during the weekend. Price variations will be particularly impacted by fluctuations in wind power generation, which will momentarily be very low on Monday and Tuesday. Towards the end of the week, wind generation will significantly increase, helping to maintain low prices.
