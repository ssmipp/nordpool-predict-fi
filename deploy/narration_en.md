*Electricity prices will experience significant daily variations during the coming week: on Wednesday, prices will momentarily rise above 30 cents, but towards the end of the week and weekend, prices will drop to very low levels, even turning negative on Saturday.*

There is an ongoing maintenance outage at the Olkiluoto 2 nuclear power plant, which began on 25 May 2025 at 18:00 and is estimated to end on 15 June 2025 at 18:00. This maintenance outage may affect the accuracy of the price forecast, as training data during outages is limited.

The forecast was last updated on Tuesday at 12:06.

The electricity price forecasts for the coming week will show notable variations between days. Clearly, the most expensive day will be **Wednesday**, when the average electricity price will rise exceptionally high to over 15 cents per kilowatt-hour. Wednesday's price variability will also be significant, ranging from a minimum of 4.5 cents up to a maximum of nearly 31 cents. The risk of price spikes on Wednesday will be particularly high in the morning between 8:00 and 10:00, with expected peak prices exceeding 30 cents per kilowatt-hour. Wednesday's high prices are partly explained by very low wind power production, which will bottom out at only 85 megawatts.

The price situation will change dramatically on **Thursday**, when the average market electricity price will drop significantly, to just over two cents. Price fluctuations on Thursday will be minor and mostly remain below five cents, although individual price spikes may occur in the morning hours between 7:00 and 9:00. Thursday's low prices can be explained by abundant wind power availability, averaging more than 2000 megawatts.

The weekend also appears quite affordable from the consumer's perspective. The average price on **Saturday** will remain below one cent, and during the night hours, the electricity price will briefly turn negative. Such negative prices will be seen on Saturday around midday, between 10:00 and 16:00. However, there is still a risk of individual hourly price spikes on Saturday, especially in the evening.

Prices on **Sunday** will stay moderate, around three cents, although individual spikes may occur during morning and evening hours. On **Monday** and **Tuesday**, prices will remain consumer-friendly, mostly below five cents. The possibility of price spikes has been indicated for both these days.

Overall, the week will be divided into two distinct parts: the early week Wednesday will clearly stand out due to its price spikes, while towards the end of the week, electricity prices will remain moderate or even extremely affordable. Particularly, weekend hours offer opportunities for low electricity costs.
