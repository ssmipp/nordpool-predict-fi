*This week's electricity prices will vary significantly: highest hourly rates at the beginning of the week will rise above 17 cents, but by the end of the week, prices will decrease notably, even turning negative at times.

The spot electricity prices this week will experience considerable fluctuations between the beginning and the end of the week. Early in the week, prices will be higher on average, with price spike risks especially pronounced on **Monday**, when the highest hourly price could reach up to 17,6 cents per kilowatt hour. This price peak is expected during the morning hours between 08:00‚Äì10:00. **Tuesday** and **Wednesday** will also see clearly elevated price peaks, with individual hourly rates potentially exceeding 14 cents around 08:00‚Äì10:00.

As the week progresses, prices will significantly decline. On **Thursday**, the average electricity price will drop down to just 2,1 cents. This favorable price development will continue on **Friday**, when electricity prices are expected to be the week's lowest. Negative prices will also occur early Friday morning between 03:00‚Äì06:00, reaching as low as -0,5 cents.

On **Saturday**, the price level will remain low, but intra-day fluctuations are expected. Saturday will again witness negative prices during early morning hours, but in the evening from 19:00‚Äì21:00 electricity rates may rise as high as nine cents.

**Sunday** will be relatively stable and moderate in terms of price levels, without large fluctuations expected. The day's average price will settle around 2,4 cents, with prices varying only slightly above four cents at most.

The significant price variation throughout the week can partly be explained by fluctuations in wind power generation. Low wind production early in the week, notably on Wednesday morning with only 313 MW, will clearly increase hourly prices. Towards the end of the week, wind power generation will increase considerably, explaining the lower electricity prices, particularly on Thursday and Friday.
