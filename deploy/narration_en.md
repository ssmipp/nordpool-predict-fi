The upcoming week's electricity price forecast indicates clear variability. Early in the week, electricity prices will reach their highest levels, whereas from midweek onwards, prices will decline significantly.

On **Monday**, **Tuesday**, and **Wednesday**, forecasts show the week's highest peak prices, with electricity rates briefly rising to nearly 17 cents per kilowatt-hour. On Monday, the highest prices will occur in the morning between 8:00 and 10:00, exceeding 15 Â¢ for two hours. On Tuesday, a similar peak will occur in the evening hours between 19:00 and 21:00, and on Wednesday morning between 8:00 and 10:00. On these days, wind power production will also be very low at certain times, explaining the high price peaks.

On Thursday and Friday, considerably lower electricity prices are forecasted. The average prices on these days will be around two cents or below. On Friday, electricity prices may even drop to negative values during nighttime and early morning hours. The week's lowest price will occur early Friday morning from 5:00 to 7:00, with prices forecasted to dip as low as -0,5 cents.

On Saturday and Sunday, electricity prices will remain moderate, though prices are expected to rise slightly toward the end of the week. On Saturday, price variation will be greater, with the weekend's highest price occurring on Saturday evening between 19:00 and 21:00, when the price will approach nine cents. Sunday's prices will be steadier again, without significant fluctuations expected.

The most affordable days of the week will be Thursday and Friday, with prices expected to remain low throughout these days. The beginning of the week will be clearly more expensive, especially during certain morning and evening hours early in the week.
