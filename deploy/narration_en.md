The Olkiluoto 2 nuclear power plant is currently undergoing maintenance. The maintenance break started on 25.5.2025 at 18:00 and is forecasted to last until 15.6.2025 at 18:00. This maintenance break may affect the accuracy of the price forecast because training data during maintenance breaks is limited.

In the coming days, electricity prices will vary considerably. The week's highest daily average price will occur on **Friday**, with electricity costing on average 4.9 cents per kilowatt-hour. On Friday, intraday price variations will be significant: electricity will be inexpensive in the nighttime hours, around 1 cent, but between 8‚Äì10 in the morning, prices will rise above 10 cents, peaking at 12.3 ¬¢ around 9:00. This is clearly due to low wind power production, which will drop to a minimum of only 371 megawatts during the night and stay low throughout the day (averaging 561 MW).

On **Saturday**, prices will decline significantly. The day's average price will fall to just 1.1 cents, and in the afternoon between 14:00‚Äì16:00 electricity will even reach negative prices (-0.2 ¬¢ at 14:00 and -0.3 ¬¢ at 16:00). This is largely influenced by high wind power production, which will reach over 3000 megawatts at its peak (3100 MW around 23:00).

The week's most affordable day will be **Sunday**, with an average negative price of -0.2 ¬¢. On Sunday, electricity will be free or even negatively priced almost all day, especially between 10:00‚Äì15:00, during which prices will consistently remain below -1 cent. Relatively high wind power production, averaging 2552 MW, partially explains this exceptionally affordable day.

Starting from **Monday**, electricity prices will normalize but remain quite low, around one cent per kilowatt-hour. On Wednesday, daytime prices will temporarily rise slightly above five cents (5.2 ¬¢ around 8:00), but overall the day will remain close to the week's generally low price level. On Thursday, prices will continue on a moderate note, averaging below one cent (0.9 ¬¢).

Overall, this week's electricity price level will be clearly inexpensive, apart from brief price spikes on Friday morning when the price briefly rises above 12 cents. Consumers may wish to pay attention to these individual price spikes when scheduling their consumption.
