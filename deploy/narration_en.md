*In the coming week, electricity prices will remain mostly affordable, but clear price increases are expected on Tuesday, especially during the morning hours. Prices will stay moderate on other days, and during the weekend, electricity will even drop to negative levels, indicating that production will occasionally exceed consumption.*

The Olkiluoto 2 nuclear power plant is currently undergoing a maintenance outage. The outage started on May 25, 2025 at 18:00, and it is expected to end on June 15, 2025 at 18:00. This maintenance outage may affect the accuracy of the following forecast, as training data during maintenance periods is limited.

During the upcoming week, electricity prices will mostly remain at affordable levels. Daily average prices will fluctuate around zero or slightly above on most days. However, negative prices will also occur, particularly during nighttime hours, indicating that electricity production will occasionally exceed demand.

**Tuesday** clearly stands out as the most expensive day of the week. On that day, the average price will rise above three cents, and peak hourly prices could approach almost ten cents per kilowatt-hour. There is a risk of price spikes on Tuesday, especially during morning hours between 7‚Äì9 a.m. This is due to the forecasted very low minimum wind power production combined with a morning peak in demand. The price is expected to approach ten cents on Tuesday morning at 8 a.m.

Single hourly price spikes could also occur on **Wednesday**, **Thursday**, **Friday**, and **Saturday**, although daily average prices will remain moderate on these days. However, the hourly maximum prices on these days will not reach the levels seen on Tuesday, remaining clearly under five cents. On Wednesday morning between 8‚Äì10 a.m., the price is expected to peak slightly above four cents.

**Saturday**, on the other hand, will emerge as the cheapest day of the week. The daily average price will even drop to negative. Throughout the day on Saturday, electricity prices will remain at very low levels, and no significant price spikes will occur.

The week's lowest prices will usually occur during nighttime hours, especially between 2‚Äì5 a.m. Price fluctuations during the week will largely result from variations in wind power production. On Tuesday, wind power production will be very weak, explaining the day's higher prices. On Monday, however, strong wind conditions will help keep electricity prices very low.
