The Olkiluoto 2 nuclear power plant is currently undergoing maintenance. The maintenance outage began on 25 May 2025 at 18:00 and is expected to conclude on 25 June 2025 at 18:00. The maintenance may affect the accuracy of the forecast, as training data during such outage periods is limited.

During the coming week, electricity prices will vary considerably from day to day. Significant price differences are particularly noticeable on public holidays, when electricity demand is usually lower. However, the week will start with moderate pricing.

On **Wednesday**, the anticipated daily average price will be 1.8 cents per kilowatt-hour, but prices will briefly rise above 10 cents between 7:00 and 9:00 in the morning. On **Thursday**, the average price will decrease slightly to 1.2 cents, and prices throughout the day will remain moderate, with peak prices staying at four cents.

On the public holiday, **Friday**, electricity consumption is expected to be lower, yet individual price spikes may still occur, particularly between 7:00 and 9:00 in the morning, when prices will briefly exceed 10 cents. Friday's average price of 2.9 cents will be the highest of the week, primarily because wind power production will drop as low as 445 megawatts.

Negative hourly prices are anticipated between 13:00 and 18:00, with the price dropping as low as -1.4 cents.

On **Sunday**, electricity prices will stay low throughout nearly the entire day, with an average price of just 0.2 cents. This day will be the cheapest of the week, and even the day's maximum price will not exceed 1.4 cents. Negative hourly prices may occur during the night.

At the beginning of next week, on **Monday** and **Tuesday**, electricity prices will remain moderate. Monday's average price will be 1.8 cents, and Tuesday's will be 0.9 cents, with no significant price fluctuations on these days.
