The Olkiluoto 2 nuclear power plant is undergoing maintenance. The maintenance outage started on 25.5.2025 at 18:00 and is estimated to end on 15.6.2025 at 18:00. The outage may affect the accuracy of the forecast, as training data during maintenance outages is limited.

There will be clear price variations between different days during the week. **Sunday** stands out with particularly low prices, as the day's average price is slightly negative (-0.1 Â¢). Sunday's lowest hourly price will be -2.4 Â¢, and even the highest prices remain at only 3.3 cents. Multiple negative-priced hours are expected, especially from 11:00 to 16:00, when electricity prices will remain below zero.

The week's highest prices will occur on **Monday**, when the average price will rise to 5.6 cents, peaking at 16.4 cents. Price spikes are expected, especially in the morning hours around 7:00â€“9:00. Wind power production on the same day will be at a low level, dropping to as little as 378 MW, partially explaining Monday's high peak price.

On **Tuesday** and **Wednesday**, the average electricity price will remain close to five cents, with Tuesday's maximum at 12.0 Â¢ and Wednesday's at 12.3 Â¢. Price spike risks are present on both days, especially during morning hours. Wind power production will remain relatively stable these days and does not notably explain the higher prices.

Towards the end of the week, prices will moderate. On **Thursday** and **Friday**, electricity prices will be affordable, averaging 2.7 Â¢ on Thursday and 3.5 Â¢ on Friday. Thursday will have the smallest price variation of the week, with prices fluctuating only between 0.9â€“5.4 cents. On Friday, price variation will increase again, with the highest prices expected in the evening hours around 19:00â€“21:00.

On **Saturday**, prices will again remain very low, averaging only 0.7 cents. Negative prices will appear once more during the day, with the lowest hourly price at -1.3 Â¢ around midday. Despite this, the risk of occasional price spikes will persist.
