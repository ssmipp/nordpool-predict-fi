During the upcoming week, electricity prices will vary considerably from day to day, more than usual. In particular, the price forecast for **Sunday** will differ notably from other days. Sunday's average price will be exactly 5.0 cents, yet significant fluctuations will occur within the day: the lowest predicted price will be below one cent (0.8 Â¢), while the highest price will climb over 13 cents around 8:00 in the morning. Sunday thus carries an elevated risk of price spikes during individual hours.

**Monday** and **Saturday** will stand out as the week's most affordable days. Average prices on both days will remain below two cents. Monday's average will be 1.4 cents, with individual hours even dropping below one cent. Monday's low prices will largely be explained by strong wind power production, averaging nearly 2740 MW throughout the day. Saturday's price level will also be low, with an average price of 1.8 cents.

On **Tuesday** and **Friday**, price levels will rise somewhat from Monday's affordable figures but will remain moderate, around four cents on average. On Tuesday, price variations will be more pronounced, with the highest price reaching almost ten cents around 20:00 in the evening. Tuesday also carries a noted risk of price spikes during individual hours.

On **Wednesday** and **Thursday**, prices will settle at the week's higher levels. On both days, the average price will exceed five cents per kilowatt-hour. Thursday's peak price of 8.4 cents is expected to occur between 19:00 and 21:00. Wind power generation figures for Thursday are relatively low, partially explaining higher prices and price variability. Both days have a notified risk of price spikes.

The week's price trend indicates that large differences may occur between individual hours. Particularly around 8:00 in the morning and 20:00 in the evening, prices may rise clearly above daily averages. This will be especially evident on Sunday, Tuesday, and Thursday, when individual, higher-priced hours are likely. It is advisable to follow the implementation of price forecasts closely each day, as potential changes in wind forecasts may affect final prices.
