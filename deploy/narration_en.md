In the coming days, electricity prices will fluctuate noticeably, though average price levels will generally remain affordable. The week's price variation is relatively large, with the lowest daily average price occurring on **Friday**, when average prices will settle around one cent per kilowatt-hour. Friday is a public holiday, which often results in lower than usual electricity demand and consequently reduced prices. On Friday, electricity prices may even become negative during morning and afternoon hours. Negative prices are also expected on **Thursday**, when the daily average price will remain moderate at around 1.4 cents per kilowatt-hour.

The week's highest single prices will occur on **Tuesday**, when electricity prices could peak as high as 16.3 ¢/kWh. The highest prices will occur around nine in the morning, between 8:00 and 10:00. Tuesday's average price is also the week's highest, around 5.6 cents, though this remains a reasonable level.

**Monday** and **Wednesday** will also experience considerable intraday price fluctuations. On Monday, the most expensive hours will occur in the evening, approximately between 19:00 and 21:00, when prices could approach 13 cents. On Wednesday, the price spike will occur around nine in the morning, when prices could rise above ten cents. On these days, fluctuations in wind power production will notably influence electricity prices, as wind generation will be rather low at certain hours, contributing to higher peak prices.

**Saturday** and **Sunday** will have relatively affordable average prices, although Sunday will experience some morning and evening price variations. Saturday, also a public holiday, will see moderate electricity prices without significant peaks anticipated.

The Olkiluoto 2 nuclear plant maintenance outage will continue throughout the forecast period, potentially adding uncertainty to these predictions. Electricity users should be aware that forecasted prices, especially for individual hours, may still change.
