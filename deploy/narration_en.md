At the beginning of the week, **Monday** clearly stands out in the price forecast, with an expected average electricity price of 5.6 cents per kilowatt-hour. Monday will also experience the week's largest price variation: the lowest predicted hourly price slightly drops to negative, at -0.2 cents, while the highest hourly price will rise to 14.9 cents. On Monday, the risk of price spikes will be significant, especially in the evening between 18:00 and 20:00, when the electricity price may rise notably above the forecasted 14.9 cents.

Starting from Tuesday, electricity prices will see a clear drop. **Tuesday‚Äôs** average price will be 2.6 cents, and from Wednesday to Sunday, average prices will remain affordable, below the three-cent level. The week's most affordable day will be **Thursday**, when the average price will be only 1.2 cents. Price fluctuations on Thursday will also remain moderate, with the day's most expensive hour costing only 3.4 cents.

Negative electricity prices will appear frequently during the week, especially at night. On Wednesday, early morning hours between 03:00 and 05:00 will see the lowest predicted price of -0.7 cents. Negative minimum prices are also expected on Friday and Saturday.

Friday and Saturday are public holidays, leading to lower-than-usual electricity demand. This clearly shows in Friday‚Äôs affordable average price of only 1.5 cents per kilowatt-hour. Although Saturday‚Äôs average price will rise slightly to 2.9 cents, a negative minimum price (-0.3 ¬¢) will also occur.

Over the weekend, particularly on Saturday, wind power production will remain at a relatively low average level (1344 MW). This may partly explain Saturday‚Äôs slightly higher average price compared to other days of the week. Saturday also carries a risk of short-term price spikes.
