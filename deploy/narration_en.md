*In the coming week, electricity exchange prices will remain mostly affordable, though Wednesday and Saturday stand out with significantly higher momentary price spikes. Negative hourly prices on certain nights offer opportunities to save on electricity costs, particularly during the nights preceding Tuesday and Thursday.*

The Olkiluoto 2 nuclear power plant is currently undergoing scheduled maintenance, which started on 25 May 2025 at 18:00 and is expected to end on 25 June 2025 at 18:00. The maintenance outage may affect the accuracy of the electricity price forecast as training data during maintenance periods is limited.

The forecast was last updated on Monday at 14:24.

In the coming days, electricity exchange prices will see some variation, although average prices remain mostly affordable. On **Tuesday** and **Thursday**, average electricity prices will stay particularly low, below one cent per kilowatt-hour. These days will also feature negative minimum prices during overnight hours, especially during the night preceding Thursday, when the lowest price dips down to -1.0 cents.

The clear exception of the week will be **Wednesday**, when the average electricity price rises to 4.8 cents per kilowatt-hour. Wednesday will also experience the highest single price spike of the week, occurring in the morning between 8â€“10 AM, with forecasted prices rising above 20 cents. The risk of price spikes at this time is considerable, due mainly to very low wind power generation, which momentarily drops to about 300 megawatts during the morning hours.

The influence of public holidays will be visible on **Friday** and **Saturday**, when electricity demand may be lower than usual. Nevertheless, especially on Saturday morning between 8â€“10 AM, there is a notable risk of high prices, with forecasted rates exceeding 10 cents. Saturday's average price will rise to nearly four cents, partly explained by relatively low wind power production throughout the day.

Sunday and next Monday appear somewhat more moderate. Sunday's electricity price remains below two cents on average, although hourly prices may briefly rise up to four cents. On Monday, the price level slightly increases but remains affordable, averaging around two cents.

Overall, the upcoming week provides electricity users with affordable average prices, but individual hours, particularly Wednesday and Saturday mornings, may see significant price spikes.
