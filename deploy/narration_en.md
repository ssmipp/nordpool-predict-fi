The outlook for electricity market prices varies considerably over the coming days. However, average daily prices will remain at moderate levels, reaching at most around two and a half cents. No exceptionally high daily averages are expected, yet prices may still rise significantly during individual hours.

The week's most affordable day will be **Sunday**, with an average electricity price close to zero, only 0.1 cents per kilowatt-hour. On Sunday, prices will even dip into negative territory during nighttime and morning. Similar brief negative prices will also occur on **Wednesday**, **Thursday**, **Friday**, and **Tuesday**.

However, the risk of price spikes exists on the public holiday **Friday**, when the maximum electricity price will climb above 10 cents around eight o'clock in the morning. At that time, wind power production will be very low, explaining the price increase. Individual price spikes are also possible on **Saturday** and **Sunday**. On Saturday, the highest priced period will occur around eight in the morning, when electricity costs approximately nine cents. On Sunday, the highest price will occur around ten in the morning, reaching about two cents.

The week's highest maximum prices are expected on **Friday** morning between 7:00 and 9:00, when electricity prices will exceed 10 cents. During this period, wind power production will drop significantly, driving up prices. Another expensive period occurs Saturday morning between 7:00 and 9:00, when the price approaches nine cents.

Negative price periods occur on multiple days, especially during nighttime and early morning hours. Besides Sunday, electricity prices will briefly dip below zero early Thursday morning between 2:00 and 4:00. High wind power production at these times will cause supply to exceed demand, leading to negative prices.

Overall, the week's price expectations remain moderate, despite occasional fluctuations. The most affordable times for consumers will typically be during nighttime and early morning, whereas morning and early afternoon hours will bring higher prices, particularly on Friday and Saturday.
