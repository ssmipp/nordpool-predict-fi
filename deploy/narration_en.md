Electricity spot-price expectations for the coming week will vary from day to day. The week will start on **Monday** with the highest prices, average price reaching 4.8 cents and the maximum price peaking as high as 11.6 cents. There will be a risk of price spikes especially in the morning hours between 9:00 and 11:00, when hourly prices will exceed 10 cents.

On **Tuesday**, prices will slightly decrease, with an average price of 2.8 ¢. Individual hourly peaks still remain high, reaching up to 8.8 cents in the morning between 8:00 and 10:00. The risk of price spikes will persist, although the price level is somewhat lower than Monday.

Midweek, electricity prices will drop further to lower levels. On **Wednesday**, the average price will be less than one cent, only 0.7 ¢, and the price range will be wide: at its cheapest, electricity will even be negatively priced, at -0.8 ¢ between 4:00 and 7:00, while the highest prices (slightly above five cents) will occur mid-morning between 8:00 and 10:00. On **Thursday** and **Friday**, the price level will remain low, with average prices at 1.3 and 1.7 cents respectively. However, both days carry the risk of temporary price spikes.

Towards the weekend, particularly on **Saturday** and **Sunday**, prices will be very low. **Saturday's** average price will be only 0.9 cents, with the cheapest hours from 12:00 to 15:00 even clearly negative, as low as -2.8 cents. On **Sunday**, the daily average price will drop even further, to just 0.2 cents, and several hours of negative pricing will again occur.

Throughout the week, intra-day price fluctuations will be significant. Especially at the beginning of the week, price spikes will be possible, while over the weekend prices will be extremely low and even negative. Consumers might want to follow electricity prices more closely at the start of the week to time their consumption to cheaper hours.
