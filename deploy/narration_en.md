*At the start of the week, electricity prices will rise significantly, with potential price spikes during morning hours, but as the week progresses, average electricity prices will clearly decline, reaching even negative hourly prices later in the week due to strong wind power generation.*

The Olkiluoto 2 nuclear power plant is undergoing maintenance. The maintenance outage began on May 25, 2025, at 18:00 and is expected to end on June 15, 2025, at 18:00. This maintenance outage may affect the accuracy of the electricity price forecast, as available training data during maintenance periods is limited.

Forecast updated on Sunday at 03:18.

The week's electricity price forecast shows notable variation. In the early part of the week, the average electricity prices will remain relatively high. However, as the week progresses, prices will significantly decrease starting Thursday. The most expensive days of the week will be **Monday** and **Tuesday**, with average daily prices at 6.4 and 6.8 cents per kilowatt-hour, respectively. On Monday, prices will vary significantly throughout the day, reaching their peak between 8 and 10 in the morning, when the price is expected to rise up to 18.3 cents. The sharp fluctuation in prices is explained by Monday's very low minimum wind power production (392 MW), which increases the risk of exceptionally high price spikes.

On **Tuesday**, peak prices will occur in the morning between 8 and 10, when the price will rise above 15 cents. Tuesday's low wind power during the morning hours (minimum 669 MW) also increases the risk of price spikes.

Midweek, on **Wednesday**, the average electricity price will drop clearly below four cents. During the day, prices will fluctuate moderately, peaking at 10.4 cents in the morning between 8 and 10, but the risk of price spikes is lower compared to the early week.

Towards the end of the week, electricity prices will decrease further. On **Thursday** and **Friday**, negative hourly electricity prices will be observed, especially during the early morning hours. On Thursday, the lowest price (-0.5 cents) occurs between 3 and 5 in the early morning. Friday's lowest hourly price (-0.9 cents) appears between 5 and 7 in the morning. On these days, wind power generation will be strong, thus bringing down average electricity prices.

The cheapest day of the week is **Saturday**, when the average electricity price remains below one cent. On Sunday, the average price will remain moderate, below two cents. During the weekend, prices will remain moderate, although there is a slight risk of momentary price spikes during individual hours on Saturday and Sunday.
