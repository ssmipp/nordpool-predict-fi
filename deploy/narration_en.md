During the upcoming week, electricity prices will vary noticeably from day to day. Daily average prices, however, will remain low, below two cents per kilowatt-hour. Almost every day will see negative hourly electricity prices, especially during nighttime and afternoon hours.

The highest prices of the week will occur on **Friday**, with the maximum electricity price forecasted at 6.5 cents around 08:00 in the morning. On the same day, wind power production will drop to a minimum of 911 megawatts in the morning, partly explaining the higher price during peak morning consumption.

Higher maximum prices will also occur on **Tuesday** and **Thursday**. On Tuesday, the maximum price will reach 5.8 cents around 08:00 in the morning. Thursday's price peak is expected at around nine in the morning, when prices will rise to almost five cents per kilowatt-hour. On both days, wind power generation will remain relatively low in the morning hours, contributing to increased prices.

The most affordable electricity prices of the week will occur on **Sunday**, when the daily average price will remain negative, around -0.3 cents per kilowatt-hour. Sunday afternoon between 15:00 and 17:00 will see the week's lowest prices, dropping as low as -1.5 cents per kilowatt-hour. On Sunday, wind power production will occasionally be abundant, partly explaining the low prices.

Overall, the week's price levels are expected to remain moderate and affordable. However, brief price spikes may occur during peak morning consumption hours on most days. Negative prices will continue to be common, especially during nighttime and afternoon hours.
