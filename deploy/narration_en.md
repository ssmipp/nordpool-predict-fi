*The market electricity price will remain moderate during the upcoming week, but on Tuesday morning hours, prices will momentarily rise due to weak wind power production. Over the weekend, prices will even turn negative, with Sunday's public holiday further reducing electricity demand.*

The Olkiluoto 2 nuclear power plant is currently undergoing maintenance. The outage began on 25 May 2025 at 18:00 and is expected to end on 15 June 2025 at 18:00. The maintenance outage may affect forecast accuracy, as training data during outages is limited.

The coming week will see moderate electricity pricing, with some variations observed between days. Average prices will remain low throughout the week, and no single day will be particularly expensive. Several days will even feature negative minimum prices, especially during nighttime hours.

**Tuesday**, however, will stand out slightly due to a higher maximum price, reaching 7.4 cents between 7:00 and 9:00 in the morning. This elevated price will partly be explained by Tuesday's weak wind conditions, with wind power production dropping below 400 MW at its lowest point. Tuesday's average price will also be the week's highest, at 2.5 cents per kilowatt-hour.

On other weekdays, price fluctuations will remain modest. On **Wednesday** and **Thursday**, prices will vary slightly, from negative figures to around two cents, but the price rise will remain controlled. On Thursday afternoon, between 14:00 and 16:00, prices will briefly rise to 2.6 cents, still far from high peaks.

Over the weekend, pricing will become particularly affordable. On **Saturday**, prices will stay negative throughout the day, ranging between -2.1 and -0.1 cents. This will be partly due to abundant wind power production, maintaining a high average level of around 2700 MW throughout the day.

On **Sunday**, a public holiday, electricity demand may be lower than usual. This will be reflected in prices, with the day's minimum price dropping to as low as -3.2 cents during the afternoon between 14:00 and 16:00. In the evening, from 20:00 to 22:00, the weekend's clearest price variation will occur, temporarily rising to 4.5 cents.

Overall, electricity pricing for the coming week will remain moderate without significant surprises.
