The Olkiluoto 2 nuclear plant is currently undergoing scheduled maintenance, which began on 25.5.2025 at 18:00 and is forecast to end on 15.6.2025 at 18:00. This maintenance outage may affect the accuracy of the price forecast since historical training data during such outages is limited.

This weekâ€™s electricity price forecast will show clear variations between days. The weekend in particular will be inexpensive, while prices at the start of the week will rise significantly higher. Negative minimum prices will occur on several days.

The week's lowest prices will occur on **Saturday** and **Sunday**, with an expected average price of only 0.1 cents. Saturday's price level will remain very low throughout the entire day. On Sunday, prices will even dip into negative territory in the afternoon between 13:00â€“17:00, reaching as low as -2.4 cents around 16:00. Sunday is a public holiday, which typically reduces electricity demand and partly explains the low prices.

The highest prices of the week will occur on **Monday**, when electricity prices will peak at 15.8 cents in the morning between 7:00â€“9:00. Mondayâ€™s average price will rise to 5.3 cents. There is a high risk of price spikes occurring on individual hours on Monday, meaning actual peak prices could exceed the forecast. The high price level on Monday will partly be explained by low wind power generation, dropping even below 400 megawatts at its lowest.

On **Tuesday** and **Wednesday** there will also be upward pressure on electricity prices. Tuesdayâ€™s average price will be 5.0 cents, with the highest prices occurring in the evening around 19:00â€“21:00. Wednesdayâ€™s average price is forecast to be 4.8 cents, with higher prices possibly occurring in the morning hours between 8:00â€“10:00. Both days carry risks of isolated price spikes, but maximum prices will remain clearly below Mondayâ€™s peak.

Toward the end of the week, prices will drop again to more moderate levels. On **Thursday**, the average price will be 1.3 cents and on **Friday** 2.4 cents. Price variations during these days will be moderate with no significant price spikes anticipated.
