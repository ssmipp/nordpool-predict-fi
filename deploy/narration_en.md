Olkiluoto 2 nuclear plant is currently undergoing a maintenance outage. The plant's nominal capacity is 890 MW, but available capacity during the outage is 0 MW. The maintenance began on 25.5.2025 at 18:00 and is estimated to end on 15.6.2025 at 18:00. The end date is a forecast. The maintenance outage may affect the accuracy of the price forecast due to limited historical data during such outages.

The electricity price development during the week will show considerable variation. Prices are expected to remain very low during the weekend, but at the start of next week, the price level will rise significantly.

On **Friday** and **Saturday**, prices are expected to be particularly low. On Saturday, the average electricity price will stay very close to zero, at just 0.1 cents per kilowatt-hour. Negative hourly prices will appear on both days, especially on Saturday afternoon between 12:00â€“14:00, when the price may drop as low as -1.8 cents.

Prices on **Sunday** will also remain very low, with the daily average price below zero. Due to Sunday being a public holiday, electricity demand could be lower than usual, helping to keep prices low. The lowest hourly price on Sunday, -2.5 cents, will be the lowest of the entire week.

On **Monday**, electricity prices will rise notably higher. The day's forecasted average is 5.9 cents, clearly distinguishing it from the rest of the week's price trends. This rise can be partly attributed to weak wind power production, averaging only 1348 megawatts. Particularly in the morning between 7:00â€“9:00, prices may spike, reaching even above 15 cents. Thus, Monday carries a high risk for peak prices during certain hours.

On **Tuesday**, **Wednesday**, and **Thursday**, price levels will also be distinctly higher than during the weekend, yet lower than Monday. Tuesday's average prices are expected to be 4.4 cents, Wednesday 2.4 cents, and Thursday 1.7 cents per kilowatt-hour. These days may experience occasional price peaks, especially in morning and evening hours, although maximum prices will remain below Monday's levels.

The weekly price forecast clearly shows a marked difference between the weekend and weekdays. Very low weekend prices will transition to higher levels immediately starting Monday. Fluctuations in prices are driven particularly by variations in wind power generation and lower weekend demand due to the public holiday.
