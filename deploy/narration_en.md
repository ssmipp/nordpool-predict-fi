*Electricity market prices will fluctuate significantly during the coming week: early in the week, high price peaks are expected during mornings due to low wind power production, while prices will clearly decline by the end of the week, even reaching negative values at certain hours.*

The Olkiluoto 2 nuclear power plant is currently undergoing maintenance. The maintenance started on May 25, 2025, at 18:00 and is expected to end on June 15, 2025, at 18:00. The maintenance outage may affect the accuracy of electricity market price forecasts due to limited training data availability during such outages.

Forecast updated on Saturday at 14:23.

The electricity market prices will vary greatly between different days in the upcoming week. Early in the week, the average electricity price will rise notably higher compared to other days.

The week's highest average price, 6.8 cents, will occur both on **Monday** and **Tuesday**. On these days, the risk of price spikes will also be high, especially in the morning hours between 7:00 and 9:00. Monday's peak price might rise even above 19 cents between 8:00 and 10:00 in the morning. Similarly, Tuesday's highest price is expected to be around 16.7 cents at roughly the same morning hours.

On **Wednesday**, prices will decrease to more moderate levels. The average price will remain slightly below five cents, although a peak of over 12 cents is anticipated from 8:00 to 10:00 in the morning. The risk of price spikes remains present on Wednesday as well, but less significantly than earlier in the week.

The most affordable days of the week will be **Thursday**, **Friday** and **Saturday**, when the average electricity price stays below one cent. On Thursday and Friday nights, prices will even turn negative, meaning extremely inexpensive consumption during those hours. Saturday will see the lowest price, reaching as low as -1.1 cents at midday.

The particularly high prices on **Monday** and **Tuesday** will partly result from low wind power production. The minimum wind power output on both days will clearly remain below 400 megawatts, significantly driving up electricity prices. Towards the end of the week, wind power production will rise back to normal or even above average levels, contributing to the low prices.

The public holiday on **Sunday** will have a very moderate average price, about 0.3 cents per kilowatt-hour, partly due to lower consumption typical of holidays.
