In the coming week, electricity spot prices will vary significantly from day to day. The range will extend from Saturday morning's -2,0 cents up to Tuesday morning's maximum price of 13,6 cents. On average, however, prices will remain affordable, clearly avoiding expensive levels.

The highest daily average price will occur on **Tuesday**, when the daily average reaches five cents per kilowatt-hour. On Tuesday morning around nine o'clock, prices will peak at over 13 cents between eight and ten in the morning. The risk of brief price spikes is high during these specific morning hours. The reason for the price increase will be especially low wind power production, dropping below 500 megawatts at its minimum.

**Friday** will also stand out slightly with a higher daily average price of 2,7 cents. On Friday morning between eight and ten, prices will approach the week's upper range, climbing close to eight cents. On that day, wind power production will remain at a lower level, which contributes to higher prices and generates a risk of price spikes.

On other days, electricity rates will remain at more affordable levels. On **Saturday**, the daily average electricity price will be exceptionally negative, at -0,5 cents per kilowatt-hour. Weekend nights and early mornings will also be particularly affordable, with negative prices observed both Saturday morning and Sunday afternoon. Sunday is a public holiday, which reduces electricity demand and helps keep prices low, with an average of 0,2 cents.

Thus, the week's lowest prices will occur during the weekend's early hours, especially on **Saturday**, when prices will be negative for most of the day. Overall, the week's price profile will be diverse, offering consumers plenty of opportunities to take advantage of affordable hours for electricity use.
