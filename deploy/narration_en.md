The Olkiluoto 2 nuclear plant is undergoing maintenance, which began on 25.5.2025 at 18:00 and is scheduled to end on 15.6.2025 at 18:00. The maintenance outage may affect the accuracy of the price forecast, as training data during such outages is limited.

The electricity price forecast for the coming days will vary noticeably from day to day. The lowest average prices of the week are expected on **Thursday** and **Saturday**, with daily averages as low as 1,1 cents. **Sunday** will also have low average prices, staying around 1,3 cents. These three days will even see negative minimum prices, meaning that electricity prices may temporarily dip below zero, particularly during nighttime hours.

The week's highest average price will occur on **Tuesday**, with an expected daily average of 5,1 cents and a price peak up to 12,4 cents occurring in the morning between 8:00 and 10:00. On Tuesday, the minimum wind power production will also be notably low (443 MW), partially explaining the anticipated high price peak during morning hours. In addition to Tuesday, the risk of price spikes will also exist on **Friday**, **Saturday**, **Sunday**, and next **Monday**.

Friday's average price will be more moderate, but the day's highest price will occur in the morning between 7:00 and 9:00, reaching up to 7,5 cents. Moving towards the weekend, daily prices on Saturday and Sunday will remain quite reasonable, although individual hours may still carry a risk of price spikes. Sunday is a public holiday, potentially leading to lower electricity demand and thus lower prices.

Next Monday, prices will rise again to somewhat higher levels, with an average daily price of 4,1 cents. Monday's highest price will occur in the morning between 8:00 and 10:00, reaching up to 9,4 cents.
