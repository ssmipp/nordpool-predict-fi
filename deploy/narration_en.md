Electricity price forecasts for upcoming days will feature significant variations. Electricity will be cheapest on **Saturday**, with an average price forecast of only 0.9 cents per kilowatt-hour. Saturday will also see the week's lowest hourly price: between 11:00 and 13:00, the electricity price will even drop to -1.5 cents. Negative prices mean electricity producers will effectively pay consumers for electricity usage during those hours.

On average, the highest prices are expected on **Tuesday**, with a daily average of 5.3 cents. On Tuesday morning, between 08:00 and 10:00, the electricity price will rise above 14 cents. Prices will also climb high on **Monday**; in the evening between 19:00 and 21:00, the hourly price will reach as high as 16 cents. These high hourly prices on Monday and Tuesday are partly explained by low minimum wind power production, clearly below 2000 MW on both days.

On **Friday**, prices will fluctuate sharply within the same day. During nighttime between 03:00 and 05:00, electricity price will briefly turn negative (-0.5 ¢), but in the evening between 19:00 and 21:00, prices will spike above 15 cents. Friday carries a high risk of price peaks on individual hours. Similarly, Monday will have a high risk of price spikes, especially in the evening.

**Thursday** and **Sunday** will be more moderate in their pricing. Thursday's average price will remain around 3.3 cents, although individual hours between 09:00 and 11:00 will exceed 8 cents. Sunday's average price is four cents, with the highest hourly prices of 8.6 cents between 19:00 and 21:00.

Overall, the coming week will see considerable price variability. Consumers would be wise to pay special attention to price variations on Saturday, Friday, and Monday.
