Electricity price developments in the coming week will be variable. The largest price differences will appear in the early part of the week, whereas fluctuations will clearly even out at a much lower level towards the end of the week.

The most expensive day of the week will be **Monday**, during which average electricity prices will rise to 9.9 cents per kilowatt hour. Monday's most expensive hours will occur around 8â€“10 in the morning, when the maximum price could reach as high as 37.6 cents. Monday's highest prices will be particularly due to low wind power production, which has a minimum of only 385 MW.

**Tuesday** and **Wednesday** will also experience higher-than-average electricity prices. Tuesday's average price will be 7.4Â¢ and Wednesday's 7.6Â¢. Both days carry a high risk of price spikes at individual hours. On Tuesday, the price spike is likely to occur in the morning hours around 8â€“10, when prices may rise up to 16 cents. Wednesday's price spike will likely occur around 8â€“10 in the morning as well, when prices could approach 23 cents. These higher prices are particularly explained by low wind power production.

The second half of the week appears significantly cheaper. During **Thursday** and **Friday**, average prices will drop considerably, with Thursday averaging 1.9 cents and Friday 1.3 cents. Negative minimum prices will also be observed early Friday morning, providing consumers the opportunity to utilize cheaper electricity hours.

Over the weekend, prices will remain moderate. On **Saturday**, the average electricity price will rise slightly to 2.1Â¢. Wind power production will fluctuate notably during the day, potentially causing brief price spikes at individual hours. On **Sunday**, prices will rise slightly further, averaging 3.1 cents per kilowatt hour, and the risk of short-lived price spikes will remain.
