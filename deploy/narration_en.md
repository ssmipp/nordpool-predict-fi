The week's electricity price forecast will show notable fluctuations between days. The cheapest days will be **Saturday** and **Sunday**, when average prices will remain under one cent per kilowatt-hour. On these days, prices will also briefly turn negative for individual hours: for example, on **Saturday** between 13:00â€“15:00, prices will drop as low as -1.2 cents, and on **Sunday** between 14:00â€“16:00, prices will reach as low as -1.8 cents.

Prices will also remain affordable on **Wednesday**, with an average price slightly above one cent. However, Wednesday will see significant price fluctuations; at 8:00 in the morning, electricity prices will briefly peak at over 14 cents when wind power production reaches its lowest point at 1042 MW. This will be the highest hourly price forecast for the whole week.

On **Thursday**, the average electricity price will remain moderate at under two cents, even though hourly prices will dip into negative territory during nighttime hours. On **Friday**, prices will rise slightly, averaging around 3.5 cents, driven upwards by lower wind power production in the morning hours. Specifically, on **Friday** between 8:00â€“10:00, prices will exceed 11 cents as wind power production falls below 1200 MW.

At the beginning of next week, prices will moderately increase. On **Monday** and **Tuesday**, average electricity prices will reach around four and five cents respectively. Wind power production will remain clearly below 2000 MW on average early in the week, contributing to higher prices. During these days, price spikes may occur especially in the morning and evening hours, when electricity demand usually peaks.

Overall, this week's price level will be fairly affordable. The weekend's negative prices and Wednesday's significant price fluctuation will be the week's clearest deviations from typical price trends.
