*Next week's electricity prices will show significant fluctuations: prices will dip into negative territory during the weekend, while Friday will see the highest price peak of the week. Wind power generation significantly affects price differences, and consumers would do well to closely monitor hourly forecasts to benefit from the cheapest hours.*

There is currently a maintenance outage at the Olkiluoto 2 nuclear power plant. The outage started on 25 May 2025 at 18:00 and is expected to end on 15 June 2025 at 18:00. This maintenance outage may affect forecast accuracy, as training data during outages are limited.

Next week's electricity prices will show clear variations between days. On average, prices will remain low, but significant fluctuations can occur within each day. Negative prices are expected on several days, particularly during the weekend.

The week's lowest average price will be on **Saturday**, remaining clearly negative at -0.5 cents per kilowatt-hour. Saturday's lowest hourly price will reach -1.5 cents, and Sunday will also see electricity prices clearly negative, falling to as low as -1.8 cents around 16:00. On these days, electricity consumers could effectively receive compensation for consuming electricity during the cheapest hours.

The highest prices will occur next **Friday**, when the day's maximum price will rise to 7.0 cents per kilowatt-hour around 08:00 in the morning. Friday's average price will also be the week's highest, at two cents per kilowatt-hour.

Tuesday's and Thursday's average prices will remain moderate, around one cent. However, both days will experience temporarily higher prices: Thursday as high as 4.3 cents between 18:00 and 20:00, and Tuesday 3.5 cents around 09:00 in the morning.

Wind power generation will significantly influence price fluctuations. On Friday, wind power production will be at the week's lowest level, averaging 1601 MW, explaining the day's high prices. Likewise, on Tuesday, the temporary minimum wind power level (870 MW) could contribute to the morning price spike.

In summary, despite mostly low daily average prices, consumers are advised to pay attention to specific hours of higher prices. Prices can vary significantly even within a single day, making precise timing of electricity use potentially beneficial.
