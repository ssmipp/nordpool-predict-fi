*The market electricity price will remain mostly affordable in the coming days, but higher peaks are expected on Wednesday and Saturday due to weak wind power generation. Early mornings on Thursday and Monday will offer negative prices at times, while the public holiday on Friday lowers consumption, keeping prices moderate.*

The Olkiluoto 2 nuclear power plant is currently undergoing maintenance. The outage began on 25 May 2025 at 18:00 and is estimated to last until 21 June 2025 at 18:00. The maintenance outage may affect forecast accuracy, as training data during maintenance periods is limited.

The electricity market price for the upcoming days will mostly remain moderate, but clear variations between days will occur. The most affordable days will be **Thursday** and **Monday**, with average prices around just one cent per kilowatt-hour. On both days, electricity prices are even expected to become negative briefly during night and early morning hours, when prices will reach their lowest levels.

The highest-priced day of the week will be **Wednesday**, with an average price of 4.9 cents and the week's clearly highest peak price of 21.2 cents per kilowatt-hour occurring during the day. This price spike is expected around 8‚Äì10 in the morning. The high maximum price results mainly from very weak wind power production, dropping as low as 374 megawatts in the morning.

**Saturday's** average price will also rise somewhat higher to 4.4 cents due again to low wind power generation, remaining below 1200 megawatts throughout the day. On Saturday around nine in the morning, prices will reach an unusually high weekend level, slightly over ten cents.

The public holiday on **Friday** will have a moderating effect, as lower than usual energy demand keeps the average price low (1.6 cents). Negative prices are also expected on Friday, especially in the early morning hours.

**Tuesday** and **Sunday** will also have some price fluctuations, but average prices will remain moderate, below three cents. However, both days have a risk of temporary price spikes, especially Tuesday morning between 8‚Äì10, when prices are expected to rise close to nine cents.

The week ends on next Monday, when prices will again be consistently low and occasionally negative, particularly during early morning hours.
