*Electricity prices will show significant variation this week: Thursday and Friday will be the cheapest days, whereas Wednesday clearly stands out with the highest prices. The risk of price spikes is greatest at the beginning of the week, when wind power production drops exceptionally low at times.*

Electricity prices will see notable fluctuations in the coming days. Early in the week, **Wednesday** stands out with the week's highest daily prices. On that day, the average price will reach 11,6 cents, while the maximum price could rise as high as 25,8 cents. There is a clear risk of price spikes on Wednesday, particularly in the morning hours between 08:00 and 10:00.

**Tuesday** will also experience strong price volatility. During the day, prices will swing significantly from negative values up to over 18 cents. The risk for price spikes will be heightened especially in the morning hours from 08:00 to 10:00 and again in the evening between 19:00 and 21:00.

The week's cheapest electricity prices will occur later in the week. **Thursday** and **Friday** will both be noticeably cheaper days. Thursday's average price will be as low as 2,1 cents, and Friday's expected average will be even lower, at just 1,4 cents. Both days may even see negative prices during nighttime hours.

Prices will rise slightly over the weekend but remain moderate. **Saturday** will see an average price of 1,6 cents, and **Sunday** will average at 3,3 cents. Both days have the potential for isolated price spikes, but they are likely to be modest compared to early-week levels.

Next **Monday** will bring slightly higher prices, with an average of 4,6 cents and a maximum price climbing close to 11 cents. Price spikes could occur during specific hours, particularly in the morning around 09:00 to 11:00.

Significant intraday price fluctuations throughout the week are largely explained by the varying availability of wind power. Particularly low wind power production on Wednesday and Tuesday's low minimum production correlate clearly with the highest prices. In contrast, abundant wind production on Thursday and Friday will keep prices low.
