The electricity price forecast for the coming days shows clear daily variations. The highest average price of the week will occur on **Wednesday**, with the daily average settling at 5.2 cents. The same day will also see the week's highest single hourly price, up to 21.3 cents between 8:00 and 10:00 in the morning. Wednesday's significant price fluctuations are primarily due to very weak wind power production during morning hours, dropping as low as 313 megawatts.

On **Saturday**, the average price also rises to a higher level of 4.8 cents. Wind power production on Saturday averages below one thousand megawatts, explaining the day's elevated price level. Saturday's price peak will occur in the morning between 8:00 and 10:00, when an individual hourly rate reaches 12.5 cents. Thus, both Wednesday and Saturday have a high risk of price spikes.

The week's most affordable days are **Thursday** and **Friday**, with average prices clearly below two cents. On Thursday, the price will dip into negative territory during the night and early morning hours between 2:00 and 5:00, with the lowest hourly price at -0.7 cents. Friday, a public holiday, also offers negative prices in the early hours between 3:00 and 4:00, with the lowest price at -0.4 cents. The lower electricity demand typical of holidays contributes to Friday's decreased price level.

At the beginning of the week, **Tuesday's** electricity price will remain moderate at 2.3 cents. Individual hours may still rise slightly higher, especially between 8:00 and 10:00 in the morning, when the price exceeds six cents. At week's end, on **Sunday** and next **Monday**, prices remain moderate, below two cents. These days do not include significant price fluctuations or expected peaks.

Therefore, the week offers both exceptionally high hourly prices and negative prices during nighttime. Consumers should pay particular attention to Wednesday and Saturday morning hours, when prices may quickly escalate to higher levels.
