The electricity price forecast for the coming days shows distinct daily variations. The most affordable days will be **Wednesday**, **Saturday**, and **Sunday**, with daily average prices hovering around one cent. The most expensive days will be **Monday** and **Tuesday**, when prices will clearly rise higher, with average prices of 6.2Â¢ on Monday and 5.4Â¢ on Tuesday.

Negative electricity prices will also occur during the week. Prices will fall briefly into negative territory during night and afternoon hours on Wednesday, Thursday, Saturday, and Sunday. The lowest prices will occur on Sunday afternoon from 13:00â€“15:00, dropping as low as -1.6 cents. Thursday will also see unusually low prices between 01:00â€“03:00, when electricity prices will reach -0.5Â¢.

The risk of price spikes has been indicated for Friday, the weekend, and the beginning of next week. Fridayâ€™s peak is expected between 08:00â€“10:00 in the morning, when prices could rise to as high as 11.5 cents. On Monday, an even higher peak is forecast for the morning between 08:00â€“10:00, potentially reaching 13.8 cents. Tuesdayâ€™s evening peak occurring between 19:00â€“21:00 could see prices up to 12.8 cents.

This week's price fluctuations are partially due to variations in wind power production. For example, on Thursday, strong wind production (over 5000 MW) will push some prices into negative territory, while weaker wind production (below 1700 MW on average) on Monday and Tuesday will notably raise the daily average price.

Sunday is a public holiday, typically reducing electricity demand. This could explain the low prices and occasional negative pricing on Sunday.
