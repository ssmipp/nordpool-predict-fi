*Electricity price forecasts for the coming days reveal clear fluctuations: Thursday and Friday will see high price peaks, whereas during the weekend, prices will even dip into negative territory. Variations in wind power generation and the effects of a public holiday on electricity demand are key factors behind these price movements.*

The Olkiluoto 2 nuclear power plant is currently undergoing a maintenance outage. The outage began on 25 May 2025 at 18:00 and is expected to end on 15 June 2025 at 18:00. This maintenance outage may impact the accuracy of forecasts, as limited historical data is available during such interruptions.

Electricity prices will fluctuate significantly through the end of the week. Price peaks will be especially noticeable on **Thursday** and **Friday**, days when the risk of individual hourly price spikes is also high. **Thursday's** expected average price will be the highest of the week, at approximately 6.1 cents per kilowatt-hour. Thursday is a public holiday, which may lower electricity demand. Nonetheless, significant variation is expected within the day: early morning hours between midnight and 2 am will see prices close to zero or even negative (-0.4 ¬¢), whereas between 8 pm and 10 pm prices are forecasted to rise above 13 cents.

On **Friday**, high-price peaks will also occur between 9 am and 11 am, reaching levels above 12 ¬¢. However, Friday's average price is more moderate, about 3.9 cents.

Prices will clearly decrease again over the weekend. **Saturday's** average price is forecasted at only 0.9 cents, with prices remaining moderate throughout the day. Saturday's lowest price, around -0.9 ¬¢, will occur at 7 am, while the highest prices will be seen in the evening between 7 pm and 9 pm, around 4.5 cents.

On **Sunday**, electricity prices will remain extremely low, with an average daily price of practically 0.0 cents. Prices will be negative several times during the day, reaching their lowest point between 3 pm and 5 pm at approximately -1.4 cents.

At the beginning of next week, on **Monday** and **Tuesday**, prices will again be slightly higher than during the weekend but still at low levels. Monday's average price will be 1.5 cents and Tuesday's 1.7 cents. Both days will experience occasional negative prices during nighttime hours.

Wind power production levels will vary considerably during the week. Particularly on Thursday and Friday, minimum wind power production will fall to very low levels, below 300 MW, partly explaining the high maximum prices on these days. On other days, wind power generation will be at higher levels, supporting lower electricity price forecasts.
