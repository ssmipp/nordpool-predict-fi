The Olkiluoto 2 nuclear power plant is currently undergoing maintenance. The maintenance outage started on 25 May 2025 at 18:00 and is expected to finish on 15 June 2025 at 18:00. This outage may affect the accuracy of the forecast, as the training data available during maintenance periods is limited.

Electricity prices for the coming week will vary somewhat from day to day. The week starts on **Tuesday** with a very affordable average price, even negative (-0.3 ¢/kWh). The cheapest hours will be in the afternoon between 12:00 and 18:00, when prices will drop to as low as -1.2 cents. For electricity users, this means they will effectively receive a small compensation for electricity consumed during those hours.

On **Wednesday**, prices will remain moderate but will gradually begin to rise. The day's average price is expected to be around 1.3 cents. Negative prices will occur in the early morning hours, whereas prices will peak slightly below four cents between 09:00 and 11:00.

On **Thursday**, which is a public holiday, the average electricity price will rise further to approximately 3.4 cents. The lower energy demand typical of public holidays may partly moderate price increases. Thursday's highest prices will occur in the evening from 19:00 to 21:00, with prices briefly rising close to seven cents. Individual hourly price spikes may occur.

On **Friday**, the average price (3.5 ¢) will remain at Thursday's level. The day's peak price (7.4 ¢) will occur in the morning between 08:00 and 10:00. Individual hourly price spikes may also occur on Friday.

**Saturday's** price level will drop again compared to mid-week, averaging around 1.6 cents. However, in the evening between 18:00 and 20:00, prices are expected to rise above nine cents. On **Sunday**, prices will return to very affordable levels (average price 0.3 ¢), with negative prices occurring in the morning.

Next **Monday**, prices will rise slightly compared to the weekend but will still remain affordable, averaging about two cents. The day's peak price, around seven cents, will occur in the morning between 08:00 and 10:00.
