*Electricity market prices will fluctuate significantly in the coming days: the weekend is expected to be very affordable, even featuring negative prices, but the start of the weekâ€”especially Monday and Tuesdayâ€”will bring high price peaks exceeding 13 cents; towards the end of the week, prices will settle back down to lower levels.*

Electricity prices will vary considerably from day to day during the coming week. Over the weekend, prices will be very low on average, and negative prices will be common, especially overnight and in the afternoon. **Saturday's** forecasted average price is -0.4 cents per kWh, with the lowest single-hour price dropping to -1.8 Â¢ during the afternoon between 13:00â€“14:00. On **Sunday**, the daily average is slightly above zero, but the day will include significant fluctuations. Early morning and afternoon prices will decline as much as -2.6 cents, whereas the highest hourly price of the weekend (5.1 Â¢) will occur Sunday evening between 19:00â€“21:00.

During the weekend, wind power generation will be abundant, particularly on Saturday, when average production approaches nearly 3,000 MW. On Sunday, wind power production will notably decrease, which, combined with lower electricity demand typical of a holiday, will lead to significant price volatility. Sunday also carries a risk of single-hour price spikes, especially in the evening between 19:00â€“21:00.

On **Monday** and **Tuesday**, the price of electricity will rise markedly compared to the weekend. Both days will experience considerable price volatility, reaching hourly peaks above 13 cents. The week's highest prices will occur Monday morning between 07:00â€“09:00 and Tuesday morning between 09:00â€“11:00, reaching approximately 13.5â€“13.8 Â¢. On Monday, the risk of price spikes is particularly high due to exceptionally low wind power generation at minimum levels of only 498 MW. This low wind power production explains Monday's peak price escalation.

Mid-week, on **Wednesday**, the price level will decrease somewhat but remain clearly higher than during the weekend. Wednesday will also see elevated hourly prices, peaking around 10 cents during morning hours.

On **Thursday** and **Friday**, prices will again return to lower levels. The average prices for both days will be slightly above one cent per kWh, and negative prices will again appear, particularly early Friday morning. There will be no risk of price spikes on these days.
