*The electricity exchange price forecast for the coming days shows clear daily variations: early in the week and during the weekend, electricity prices remain moderate, but midweek some individual hours may exceed ten cents, partly due to weaker wind power production.*

The Olkiluoto 2 nuclear power plant is currently undergoing a maintenance outage that started on 25 May 2025 at 18:00 and is expected to end on 23 June 2025 at 18:00. This outage may affect the accuracy of the forecast, as there is limited historical data available during maintenance periods.

The forecast was updated on Saturday at 12:06.

The coming week will show noticeable daily fluctuations in electricity exchange prices. The week will start with relatively affordable prices, but differences between days will be significant. The lowest average prices of the week are expected on **Monday** and **Saturday**, when average prices will clearly remain below two cents. On Saturday, there will even be negative hourly prices during early morning and morning hours, dropping as low as -0,9 cents.

Significantly higher average prices are expected on **Wednesday** and **Thursday**, when daily average prices will rise above five cents. On these days, peak prices will also be higher than on other days, with Thursday evening between 19:00‚Äì21:00 seeing prices slightly above ten cents.

However, the week's highest single hourly price is anticipated already on Sunday morning between 7:00‚Äì9:00, when electricity prices could rise above ten cents. On Sunday, the risk of price spikes is high, potentially resulting in elevated prices during individual hours. Early in the week, there is also risk of price spikes on Monday, Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday, particularly during morning and evening hours, despite moderate average prices on these days.

Variations in wind power production will somewhat influence electricity price developments during the week. On Sunday, wind power minimum production will be particularly low (299 MW), partly explaining Sunday's higher maximum price. On Wednesday and Thursday, average wind power production will remain below 2500 MW, somewhat contributing to higher daily average prices.

Towards the end of the week, prices will clearly decline. On Friday and Saturday, average electricity prices will again be lower, and prices during the weekend will remain mostly moderate or even negative during certain individual hours.
