According to price forecasts, electricity prices in the coming week will show significant fluctuations between days. However, the overall price level will remain relatively low, with average daily prices mostly staying well below five cents. The highest prices will occur early in the week, coinciding with the highest hourly peaks.

During the weekend, prices will remain moderate. On **Saturday**, the average price will be below one cent, and negative prices will occur at certain hours. Prices will reach their lowest point on Saturday afternoon between 13:00-15:00, dropping to as low as -1,0 cents. The highest price, around 3,3 ¬¢, will occur in the evening around 20:00. On **Sunday**, the price range will widen slightly, and the daily average will rise to about three cents. Evening hours between 19:00-21:00 will be the most expensive of the weekend, with prices possibly exceeding eight cents.

On **Monday** and **Tuesday**, prices will rise significantly higher compared to other days of the week. Monday's average price will be around four cents, but hourly prices may exceed ten cents between 9:00-11:00 in the morning. On Tuesday, the week's highest single price peak‚Äîapproximately 16,4 cents‚Äîis forecasted between 8:00-10:00 in the morning. The average price for Tuesday will settle above six cents, making it the week's most costly day. Both days carry a high risk of price spikes, and temporary price increases may exceed the forecasted values.

Midweek, on **Wednesday** and **Thursday**, prices will return to lower levels. Wednesday's average price will remain below two cents, with negative hourly prices again possible during the day. Thursday's prices will be particularly low, averaging only about half a cent. No price spikes are expected for Thursday.

The week concludes with **Friday**, a public holiday, resulting in potentially lower electricity demand. The average price for the day will remain very low, around 0,2 cents, with negative prices also occurring on Friday. The reduced consumption typical of a public holiday may explain this exceptionally low price level.
