The Olkiluoto 2 nuclear power plant is currently undergoing a maintenance break. The outage began on 25 May 2025 at 18:00 and is estimated to end on 15 June 2025 at 18:00. This maintenance outage may affect the accuracy of the price forecast, as training data from periods of nuclear plant outages is limited.

Considerable variation will characterize electricity price forecasts for the coming days. The most affordable days will be **Saturday** and **Sunday**, when daily average prices will remain well below one cent. Saturday's average price will be only 0.2 cents, and Sunday's 0.6 cents. Both days will also see negative minimum prices occurring during nighttime and morning hours.

In the week's price development, **Monday** will clearly stand out, with a high risk of individual hourly price spikes. The daily average price will rise to 5.1 cents, with the maximum price reaching as high as 14.6 cents. The peak price will occur in the morning, particularly between 8:00 and 10:00, when prices may surpass the forecasted maximum. This high maximum price is partially explained by Monday's very low minimum wind power production of only 826 MW.

On **Tuesday**, the average electricity price will also remain relatively high, at 4.3 cents, and in the evening between 18:00 and 20:00, the maximum price will rise to 10.9 cents. Tuesday will also carry a risk of price spikes during individual hours. **Thursday** will similarly be somewhat more expensive, with an average daily price of 4.1 cents and a maximum price rising to 10.2 cents in the evening hours between 19:00 and 21:00.

The remaining days of the week, **Friday** and **Wednesday**, will be more affordable. On Friday, prices will range from -0.4 to 6.1 cents, with a daily average price of 1.9 cents. However, Friday will still carry a risk of individual hourly price spikes. Wednesday will be slightly more affordable, with a daily average price of 1.8 cents and a more moderate price variation between 0.0 and 4.9 cents. Price spike risks should also be considered on Wednesday during individual hours.

The upcoming week's price trends indicate significant differences between individual days, both in terms of average prices and price variability. Weekend prices will remain very low, whereas at the start of the week, particularly on Monday, users should be prepared for significantly higher prices and the possibility of hourly price spikes.
