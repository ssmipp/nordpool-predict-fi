Electricity prices in the coming days are expected to remain generally affordable. Differences between days are modest, and no particularly high daily averages are forecasted. Negative hourly prices appear on several nights and early mornings, indicating temporary oversupply relative to demand.

The week's highest hourly price will occur on **Wednesday** morning between 8‚Äì10 am. At that time, the forecast price will approach nearly 13 cents. The elevated price is clearly influenced by low wind power production, which will drop to as little as 558 megawatts. Therefore, Wednesday carries a risk of occasional hourly price spikes.

On **Friday** and **Saturday**, electricity prices may also briefly rise, though the daily average prices remain below three cents. Both days are holidays, when electricity demand may be lower than usual. The reduced demand may help moderate potential price increases, even though wind power availability will occasionally be relatively low.

**Thursday**, **Monday**, and **Tuesday** are forecasted to be very affordable days, with spot prices mostly staying below four cents. Thursday's price level is among the lowest of the week, averaging just 1.2 cents. Tuesday's average price will be even lower, at only 0.9 cents.

On **Sunday**, prices will reach the lowest weekly average at just 1.1 cents. Negative hourly prices are expected during the afternoon and late evening.

Overall, the upcoming week's price developments appear very moderate. Exceptionally high daily averages or prolonged periods of high prices are not anticipated.
