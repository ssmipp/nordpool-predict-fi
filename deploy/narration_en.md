Electricity prices will remain generally affordable in the coming days. However, there will be significant variations both within individual days and between different days. The largest price fluctuations will occur on **Thursday**, when the daily average climbs to 3,0 cents and hourly peaks reach up to six cents. Thursday's price increase will particularly affect morning and evening hours, with the highest hourly price of 6,0 cents expected between 19:00 and 21:00.

On **Tuesday** and **Monday**, brief price spikes will also occur, with peak prices around four cents. Tuesday's highest prices will occur in the evening hours between 18:00 and 20:00, reaching four cents. Monday's peak price of 4,8 cents will similarly occur during evening hours between 18:00 and 20:00. On Wednesday, Friday, and Saturday, electricity prices will remain steadily low, averaging below one cent.

The week's lowest prices will be seen on **Sunday**, with an average price dipping into negative territory at -0,1 cents. Prices on Sunday will remain below one cent all day, with the lowest point (-1,3 cents) occurring in the afternoon between 12:00 and 14:00.

Wind power production will not significantly deviate from normal levels, although **Thursday** will see the week's lowest minimum production of 1174 MW. This partly explains the higher maximum price forecasted for the same day.

In general, no substantial surprises are expected in electricity prices for the coming week, but individual price spikes could occur on several days. Risks for price spikes have specifically been noted for Tuesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday, and Monday, during which hourly prices may rise higher than forecasted.
