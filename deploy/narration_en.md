The Olkiluoto 2 nuclear power plant is currently undergoing maintenance. The plant's nominal capacity is 890 MW and available capacity is currently 0 MW, translating to 0 percent availability. The maintenance began on 25 May 2025 at 18:00 and is forecast to end on 15 June 2025 at 18:00. This maintenance period may affect the accuracy of the price forecast, as training data from periods of maintenance is limited.
