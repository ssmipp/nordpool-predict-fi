Clear price variations will characterize electricity prices in the coming days. Prices are expected to peak on **Wednesday**, when the daily average reaches 12.7 cents per kilowatt-hour. During specific hours, prices will rise significantly higher. Especially between 8:00 and 10:00 in the morning, prices will exceed 24 cents, with the day's highest price occurring at 9:00, reaching as high as 27 ¬¢. The risk of price spikes is significant on Wednesday.

On **Thursday** and **Friday**, prices will settle at a clearly lower level. On Thursday, the average price will remain at two cents, and even slightly lower on Friday, at 1.9 ¬¢. On both days, prices will stay mostly below five cents, with Thursday's early-morning hours dropping even below one cent. Strong wind power production partly explains these very low prices.

**Saturday** will see the week's lowest prices. The daily average will be just 0.9 ¬¢, and electricity prices will turn briefly negative at night and in the afternoon. At its lowest, Saturday's electricity price will dip down to as low as -1.1 cents around midday. However, even on Saturday, there will be a risk of isolated hourly price spikes, particularly in the evening.

The week concludes on **Sunday**, bringing higher price expectations again. Sunday's average price will rise to 5.3 cents, with the highest spikes occurring during the evening hours between 16:00 and 20:00. Prices will rise above 12 cents at this time, reaching the day's peak of 13.3 ¬¢ at 19:00. The possibility of price spikes will be noteworthy on Sunday.

At the beginning of next week, prices on **Monday** and **Tuesday** will remain around 4.6‚Äì4.8 cents. Monday's highest price will be 9.1 ¬¢ in the morning at 10:00, and similarly on Tuesday at 9.0 ¬¢ in the morning at 8:00. On both days, there will also be a risk of price spikes, even though average prices will remain moderate.
