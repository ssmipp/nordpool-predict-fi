*Electricity market prices will fluctuate significantly this week: Wednesday will see elevated prices due to weak wind power production, while the latter part of the week offers consumers cheaper electricity, at times even with negative prices.*

The Olkiluoto 2 nuclear power plant is currently undergoing maintenance. The maintenance outage began on 25 May 2025 at 18:00 and is expected to end on 15 June 2025 at 18:00. The outage may affect the accuracy of the forecast, as training data from periods with outages is limited.

The electricity price forecast was updated on Monday at 21:28.

This week's electricity prices will experience notable daily fluctuations. Average daily prices will range from one cent to twelve cents per kilowatt-hour. The highest average prices occur on **Wednesday**, when the average price rises to 12.0 cents. Within Wednesday itself, prices will vary considerably: the lowest prices will occur at late night, between 23:00–01:00, at around three cents, while significantly higher prices are expected in the morning between 8:00–10:00, peaking over 27 cents. Consequently, the risk of price spikes will be notably high on Wednesday.

**Wednesday's** high prices can partly be explained by very low wind power production. During the day, wind power production will drop below 100 megawatts at its lowest, an exceptionally weak level. This scarcity of wind-generated electricity contributes to price volatility and elevates the risk of price spikes.

**Tuesday** will also see expensive electricity at times, as prices will rise above 24 cents per kilowatt-hour in the evening between 20:00–22:00. Intraday price differences will be significant: during early morning hours, electricity will be offered almost for free, just fractions of a cent. Tuesday's substantial variations in wind power production help explain the large price gap between nighttime and evening.

In the second half of the week, electricity prices will drop notably. On **Thursday** and **Friday**, average prices will remain below two cents. Also on **Saturday**, the average price will be low, around one cent. Negative hourly prices will also be observed during the week: particularly during daytime on Saturday, electricity prices may fall as low as -1.1 cents per kilowatt-hour, effectively paying consumers for electricity consumption.

At the end of the week, prices will rise slightly. On **Sunday** and next **Monday**, average prices will reach around four and a half cents. On both days, the highest hourly prices will rise to seven and nine cents, respectively—clearly more moderate levels compared to early-week peaks.
