Electricity prices will vary notably between individual days during the week. According to the forecast, prices will generally remain affordable, but **Tuesday** clearly stands out with significantly higher prices. On Tuesday, the daily average price will exceed six cents, and the maximum price will approach 19 cents per kilowatt-hour. The risk of price spikes will be high then, particularly during the morning hours between 8:00 and 10:00. **Monday** will also be slightly more expensive than other days, with peak prices expected around 8:00â€“10:00 in the morning.

The lowest prices of the week will occur at the start of the weekend. On **Saturday**, the average price of electricity will drop to just 0.2 cents, with prices even turning negative during the afternoon between 14:00 and 16:00. Prices on **Friday** will also be very low, averaging 0.3 cents. This may partly be due to Friday being a public holiday, leading to lower-than-usual energy demand.

Wednesday's price level will remain moderate, although isolated price spikes could occur in the morning hours between 8:00 and 10:00. On Thursday, electricity prices will be very affordable, with no risk of price spikes anticipated.

Wind power generation will fluctuate significantly throughout the week. Saturday and Friday will feature the strongest winds, resulting in high average wind power production. Tuesday's higher prices can partly be explained by low minimum wind power production, dipping below 1200 megawatts, increasing the risk of price spikes. On other days, wind power generation is expected to remain at normal levels, with no significant impact on prices.

Overall, substantial variations in electricity prices are forecast for the week, particularly due to Tuesday's elevated prices. During other days, prices are expected to remain relatively affordable, mostly staying below five cents.
