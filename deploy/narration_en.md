*Electricity prices will vary significantly in the coming days: at the beginning of the week, prices will spike momentarily due to low wind power production, whereas towards the end of the week, prices will drop considerably, even reaching negative values, thanks to strong wind power generation.*

The Olkiluoto 2 nuclear power plant is undergoing a maintenance outage, which started on 25 May 2025 at 18:00 and is expected to end on 15 June 2025 at 18:00. This maintenance outage may affect the accuracy of the price forecast, as limited training data is available during such periods.

The forecast was updated on Monday at 14:24.

As the week progresses, electricity prices will fluctuate significantly from day to day. Prices will peak on **Tuesday** and **Wednesday**, causing these days to have the week's highest average prices. Tuesday's average price will stand at 7.6 ¢, while Wednesday's average will rise to 11.4 cents per kilowatt-hour. Wednesday's maximum price will reach a high of 26.4 cents between 8:00–10:00 in the morning. This price spike will be caused by very low wind power production, dropping momentarily below 100 megawatts on Wednesday.

Midweek, **Thursday** and **Friday**, the situation will change notably. On both days, electricity prices will be exceptionally low. Thursday’s average price will be just 1.5 ¢, and Friday’s 1.7 ¢. Both days will even experience negative prices, with Thursday's lowest price at -0.3 ¢ and Friday's at -0.4 ¢. The low price levels on Thursday and Friday are partly explained by strong wind power production, which at its peak will exceed 3800 megawatts.

Prices will remain affordable also on **Saturday** and **Sunday**. On Saturday, the average price will be 1.7 cents, with Sunday slightly higher at 3.7 cents. Saturday will also see negative minimum pricing, at its lowest -0.7 ¢. During the weekend, however, there remains a risk of price spikes at certain hours; on Saturday, peak prices will occur around 20:00, and on Sunday between 18:00–20:00 in the evening.

Next **Monday**, price levels will rise again slightly, resulting in an average daily price of 4.9 cents. Intra-day variation will remain moderate, with the highest price at 11 cents between 9:00–11:00 in the morning. Monday will also carry a risk of price spikes during individual hours.

The overall picture of the week will highlight substantial variation between days and even negative prices at specific night and early morning hours. Wednesday will clearly be the most expensive day of the week, whereas Thursday and Friday will be the cheapest.
