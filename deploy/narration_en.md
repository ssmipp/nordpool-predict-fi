In the coming week, electricity prices will stay affordable on average, although there will be significant variation between days. At the start of the week, extraordinarily low prices are expected, especially on **Sunday**, when prices will even turn negative during daytime hours from 11:00 to 16:00. The lowest price of -0,7 cents will occur between 13:00 and 15:00.

The cheapest overall hours early in the week will be on **Monday**, when the day's average price will be around just one cent. Prices will remain relatively stable that day, although occasional hourly price spikes might occur. Monday will be the most affordable day in terms of average pricing.

Tuesday and Thursday will experience the week's highest prices. On **Tuesday**, the maximum price will climb up to 8,6 cents between 18:00 and 20:00, and the day's average price will be the second highest of the week at 3,2 cents. On **Thursday**, the average daily price will rise to the week's highest level, almost four cents (3,9 Â¢), and the maximum price will peak at 7,5 cents in the evening between 20:00 and 22:00.

On **Friday**, prices will stay close to Thursday's level, with an average of 3,4 cents and a maximum price again reaching 7,5 cents between 20:00 and 22:00. Also on **Saturday**, individual price spikes are possible, even though the average price will decline slightly to just over two cents.

Daily price fluctuations will be significant, especially during weekend days and early- and late-week evening hours between 18:00 and 22:00. The appearance of negative prices on Sunday and Wednesday indicates temporary oversupply conditions on the electricity markets.
