Average prices will remain low overall, and at times electricity prices will even drop into negative territory.*

The Olkiluoto 2 nuclear power plant is currently undergoing a maintenance outage, which began on 25.5.2025 at 18:00 and is expected to conclude by 15.6.2025 at 18:00. This maintenance outage may affect the accuracy of the price forecast, as training data from periods of maintenance is limited.

Electricity prices will vary notably during the upcoming week. Forecasted average prices are mainly low, below two cents per kilowatt-hour, but prices may rise significantly higher during individual hours.

The most affordable days of the week will be **Sunday** and **Monday**, when average prices will stay around zero. On Sunday, electricity prices will be negative almost throughout the day, reaching their lowest point of -1,6 cents around 16:00. On Monday, the lowest price will be -1,7 cents during the early morning hours around 3:00. Price variations on these days will be relatively moderate.

However, on **Tuesday** prices will rise markedly higher. Tuesday's average price will climb to two cents, and the daily price range will be wide, between -0,6 and 9,5 cents. On Tuesday morning between approximately 8:00 and 10:00, electricity prices will reach the week's highest forecasted level, nearly ten cents. At the same time, wind power production will be exceptionally low, only around 230 megawatts. This scarcity of wind power largely explains the high peak prices.

Significant price variations within the day will also occur on **Thursday** and **Friday**. On Thursday, peak prices will approach five cents between 8:00 and 10:00 in the morning, coinciding with lower wind production. A similar situation will occur on Friday morning between 8:00 and 10:00, when electricity prices will climb close to eight cents. On Friday morning, wind power production will drop to around 900 megawatts, contributing to higher prices.

Towards the weekend, on **Saturday**, prices will stabilize again at lower levels. Saturday's average price will remain at 0,2 cents, and prices during the day will partly fall into negative territory. Weekly price fluctuations will thus be substantial, and electricity users should particularly prepare for significantly higher prices on Tuesday morning.
