*In the coming days, electricity prices will fluctuate significantly: the week starts with higher prices, but during the weekend, prices will drop to negative levels, offering especially affordable hours on Sunday, while Friday morning may see price spikes due to low wind power production.*

Electricity prices will experience significant fluctuations in the coming days, showing clear differences between individual days. Initially, price levels will be somewhat higher, but prices will notably decrease over the weekend.

On **Thursday**, electricity is expected to cost around 4.3 cents per kilowatt-hour on average. Thursday is a public holiday, which may reduce electricity demand and thus lower prices. However, the day will see considerable price variation, ranging from 0.7 cents up to more than 10 cents. The highest prices are expected during evening hours between 19:00 and 21:00.

On **Friday**, the average price of electricity will rise slightly higher, to around 4.8 cents. Significant price variation will occur within the day, with the lowest price just over one cent, while during the morning hours between 8:00 and 10:00, electricity will cost over 14 cents per kilowatt-hour. There is a notably high risk of price spikes occurring on individual hours.

During the weekend, prices will clearly decline. On **Saturday**, the average price will be slightly above one cent, and on Sunday, even negative at -0.1 cents. On Sunday, prices will remain negative for most of the daytime, with the lowest price of -1.2 cents occurring in the afternoon. Weekend electricity users will have opportunities to benefit from exceptionally low-cost hours, especially on Sunday.

At the beginning of next week, prices will rise slightly but remain at moderate levels. On **Monday**, the average will be around one cent, and on Tuesday and Wednesday, approximately two cents. Individual higher prices are expected especially on Wednesday during morning hours, when prices may exceed eight cents.

During the week, low and even negative prices can be partly explained by occasionally abundant wind power generation. In contrast, Friday's average wind power production will be below 1000 MW, further increasing the risk of price spikes.
