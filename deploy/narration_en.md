In the coming week, the electricity price will experience significant variation. However, on average, prices will remain affordable, with daily average prices mostly below four cents.

The week's cheapest day will be **Sunday**, with the average price dropping below zero (-0,2 ¢). Throughout the day, prices will remain low, fluctuating between -1,6 and 1,6 cents. Negative prices will particularly occur during early morning and morning hours.

Noticeably higher prices will occur on **Friday**, with the day's maximum expected to reach 9,1 cents between 7:00 and 9:00 in the morning. Friday is a public holiday, which may reduce demand, but a remarkably low wind power production (566 MW) during the morning explains the price spike. Similarly, **Saturday** will see an equally high price peak between 8:00 and 10:00 in the morning, potentially reaching 9,0 ¢. Saturday is also a public holiday reducing demand; however, very weak wind power in the morning (431 MW) will elevate the price. Throughout Saturday, the price variation will be large, as prices will dip down to -2,1 cents in the afternoon. There is a significant risk of price spikes on Saturday morning hours.

Tuesday evening between 19:00 and 21:00 will also see a higher price peak, reaching up to 7,8 cents. This higher price is partially due to weaker wind power production, which will fall below 1400 MW during the day.

On other days (**Thursday**, **Monday**, and **Wednesday**), price variations are less prominent, and prices will remain low. Thursday's prices will range from -0,6 to 2,7 cents, while on Monday prices will peak at no more than 3,5 cents. Wednesday's fluctuation interval will be between -0,1 and 2,4 cents.
