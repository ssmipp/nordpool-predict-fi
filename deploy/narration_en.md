*This week's electricity prices will fluctuate significantly: early-week price peaks will be followed by low, even negative overnight prices later in the week, as abundant wind power production significantly reduces costs towards the weekend.*

Electricity prices are expected to be high on Tuesday and Wednesday. On **Tuesday**, the average price of electricity will be 8.9 cents per kilowatt-hour, peaking at nearly 20 cents. Highest prices will occur in the morning between approximately 8‚Äì10 and again in the evening from 19‚Äì21. Wind power production will at times drop to very low levels, partly explaining the significant price fluctuations. There is a considerable risk of price spikes throughout Tuesday.

On **Wednesday**, the average price will rise even higher, to 10.8 cents. The week's highest hourly price, 24.5 cents, is expected during morning hours between 8‚Äì10. The risk of price spikes is also elevated on Wednesday, especially in the morning when wind power production remains exceptionally low, down to 116 megawatts.

On Thursday and Friday, prices will noticeably drop from earlier in the week. On **Thursday**, the average electricity price will be just 1.6 cents, and on Friday it will decrease even further to 1.2 cents. Both days will see negative hourly prices overnight, with Thursday reaching -0.2 cents and Friday as low as -0.5 cents. These low prices are partially explained by strong wind power production, which remains high throughout Thursday and Friday.

Over the weekend, electricity prices will continue to stay moderate. On **Saturday**, the average price will be 1.3 cents, increasing slightly on **Sunday** to 3.0 cents. Negative hourly prices will occur during the weekend as well, reaching as low as -0.8 cents on Saturday. Weekend price fluctuations will remain moderate, and no particularly large spikes are anticipated, although isolated higher prices may occur.

Next **Monday**, the average electricity price will remain low, around 3.1 cents. Price fluctuations will be moderate, with no significant spikes expected.
