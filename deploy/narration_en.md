This week's lowest-priced days will be **Thursday** and **Saturday**, with average electricity prices below two cents per kilowatt-hour. Negative hourly prices will also occur on these days. The cheapest hours of the week will be Saturday from 13:00 to 15:00, when electricity prices dip to nearly two cents below zero.

Prices will remain generally affordable also on **Wednesday** and **Sunday**, predominantly staying below two cents. Wednesday's highest hourly price (8.4 ¢) will occur in the morning around 9:00, although the risk of peak prices on that day is low.

Higher price levels this week are forecasted on **Friday**, **Monday**, and especially on **Tuesday**. Friday's expected average price is 4.2 cents, with the highest hourly prices reaching up to 13 cents between 8:00 and 10:00 in the morning. Monday will be slightly more expensive, with an average price approaching five cents and peak prices around nine cents in the evening between 19:00 and 21:00.

This week's highest prices will occur on Tuesday, averaging 7.5 cents. Particularly expensive hours on Tuesday will occur in the evening, with the highest hourly prices possibly climbing to as much as 19.5 cents between 19:00 and 21:00. On Tuesday, minimum wind-power production will fall below 1000 megawatts, which partially explains the higher maximum prices and increases the risk of individual price spikes.

Thus, electricity prices will vary significantly throughout the week. The cheapest hours are generally at night and in the early afternoon, whereas the highest prices typically occur during morning and evening peaks in consumption.
