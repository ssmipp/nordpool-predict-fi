The electricity price forecast for the coming week will show clear variation between the days. The week's lowest prices will occur on **Friday** and **Monday**, when average prices will stay below one cent per kilowatt-hour. On Friday, a negative minimum price (-0.5 ¢) will occur in the afternoon between 14:00–16:00. A similar negative price period is also expected early next Monday morning from 2:00–4:00 (-0.1 ¢).

The week's highest average price will occur on **Thursday**, when the daily average rises to 4.8 cents, and the highest price surpasses eight cents in the evening between 19:00–21:00. Prices will also rise over the weekend, particularly on **Saturday**, when the maximum price climbs above 12 cents in the morning between 8:00–10:00. On Saturday, there will be a risk of price spikes during certain hours, meaning actual prices could exceed the forecasted values.

On **Sunday**, electricity prices will stabilize slightly, but the possibility of price spikes will remain. Sunday's highest price (9 cents) will occur in the morning between 8:00–10:00. On **Tuesday**, **Wednesday**, and again on **Thursday**, the risk of price spikes remains, though maximum prices will be more moderate compared to Saturday.

Wind power generation will show substantial variation between days. The week's lowest wind power figures will occur on Sunday, when minimum production will fall below 500 MW. On Saturday, the minimum wind power will also be low (799 MW), partly explaining the high price peak during the morning hours.

Negative prices and periods of low average prices can partly be explained by abundant wind power production, especially on Monday, when wind power availability will be very high, averaging over 3100 MW.
