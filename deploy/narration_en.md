The coming week will bring varied electricity prices. Price fluctuation will be notable, as individual price spikes are predicted for Monday and Wednesday. Prices on other days will remain more moderate.

The most expensive day of the week will be **Monday**, with an expected average price of 6.1 ¢ and a peak price reaching as high as 16.8 cents. The risk of price spikes is high, especially in the evening hours around 19:00–21:00. On **Wednesday**, electricity prices may also rise significantly, particularly in the morning between 8:00–10:00, when rates could reach 16.6 cents.

The week's cheapest days will be **Thursday** and **Friday**, when prices will mostly stay around two cents or lower. Thursday's average price is only 1.1 ¢ and Friday's 1.5 ¢. On both days, the minimum electricity prices may occasionally become negative, especially during nighttime hours.

**Friday** and **Saturday** are holidays. During these days, electricity demand might be lower than usual, which could contribute to reduced electricity prices. Despite this, there remains a risk of occasional price spikes on these days.

Clear differences in wind power production will occur between days. On Wednesday morning, wind power will briefly drop as low as 574 MW, partially explaining the high electricity prices during that morning. Similarly, Monday evening’s price peak coincides with a moment when wind power availability will be around only 1000 MW.

The week's temperatures will not impact electricity prices, as average temperatures will remain consistently in the cool range of 12–13 degrees.
