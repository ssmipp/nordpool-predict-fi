During the week, significant variation will occur in electricity price forecasts. Early in the week, prices will remain moderate, but will rise notably on Tuesday. The highest daily average price will be recorded on **Tuesday**, averaging 4.9 cents per kilowatt-hour. The variation within Tuesday itself will be considerable, ranging from 0.2 cents up to 11.6 cents. The highest hourly prices, around 11‚Äì12 cents, will occur on Tuesday morning between 8:00 and 10:00. This is largely due to wind power generation dropping below 1000 MW during morning hours. Tuesday also carries elevated risk for price spikes, meaning actual hourly prices may end up higher than forecasted.

On **Monday** and **Saturday**, electricity prices will remain very low. Saturday's average price will even be negative, at -0.7 cents per kilowatt-hour, with hourly prices dipping as low as -1.8 cents. Negative prices will also appear on Sunday, reaching as low as -2.7 cents, though Sunday's daily average will hover just above zero (0.1 ¬¢). This likely results from Sunday's status as a public holiday, leading to lower energy demand.

Price levels for Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday will remain moderate. During these days, electricity prices will show restrained variation, though some hourly fluctuations will occur. For instance, on **Thursday**, the highest price (5.4 ¬¢) will occur in the morning between 8:00 and 10:00. These days also carry some risk for isolated price spikes, although the risk is considerably lower than on Tuesday.

Overall, the upcoming week will see substantial price disparities between days. Wind conditions significantly influence these price fluctuations: notably, Tuesday's low wind conditions notably raise prices, whereas stronger weekend winds explain the lower prices. Consumers would do well to pay attention to the risk of price spikes particularly on Tuesday morning.
