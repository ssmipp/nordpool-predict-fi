The week's lowest prices will be reached on Sunday, when electricity prices will briefly dip into negative territory.*

The average daily market prices of electricity will generally remain low this week. The most significant price fluctuations will occur on **Wednesday**, when the average daily price is forecast to rise to 4.3 cents. On Wednesday, individual hours could be substantially more expensive, especially during morning hours around 8:00â€“10:00, when prices are expected to climb above 16 Â¢. Thus, Wednesday carries a high risk of price spikes.

The week's cheapest electricity will be available on **Sunday**, when the average price remains very low, at just 0.2 cents. On Sunday, electricity prices may occasionally become negative, dropping as low as -1.3 Â¢ in the afternoon between 14:00â€“16:00.

Negative pricing periods are also forecast on other days of the week. On **Thursday**, **Friday**, **Saturday**, and **Monday**, the minimum electricity prices will periodically dip slightly below zero. This indicates occasional overproduction, when supply exceeds demand, causing negative prices. Thursday and Friday average prices will remain at 1.2 cents, and Saturday's average price will stay equally low.

Fluctuations in wind power partly explain the price spikes during the week. On Wednesday, wind power production can occasionally drop very low, to just 372 MW, partially explaining the higher prices seen that day. Conversely, Thursday and Friday's low average prices are partly related to relatively strong wind production.

On **Tuesday**, the average price will still be fairly moderate at 3.0 Â¢, but individual hours could rise even above 8 cents. Tuesday's peak prices will occur during the morning hours between 8:00â€“10:00.

Next Monday, prices will rise slightly from the weekend's very low levels but will still remain moderate with an average price of 1.6 cents. Price spikes on Monday are not expected.
