Olkiluoto 2 nuclear power plant is currently undergoing a maintenance outage. The outage began on 25 May 2025 at 18:00 and is expected to end on 15 June 2025 at 18:00. This maintenance outage may affect forecast accuracy, as training data for outage periods is limited.

Electricity price development for the week ahead will be variable. Prices will mainly remain affordable, but distinctly higher peak prices are anticipated in the early part of next week. The cheapest days will be **Thursday** and **Saturday**, when average prices will hover around two cents per kWh. Negative hourly prices will also occur on these days: Thursday as low as -0,6 cents, and Saturday as low as -0,4 cents.

The week's price peaks will occur early next week. On **Monday**, the average daily price will rise to 7,7 cents, and the highest hourly price will exceed 16 cents. Monday’s peak prices will occur during morning hours between 8:00 and 10:00. High individual hourly prices will also appear on **Tuesday**, reaching as high as 19,4 cents between 19:00 and 21:00. Tuesday’s average price will be 6,6 cents.

Prior to next week's price peaks, there will already be a risk of elevated prices during this coming weekend. On **Friday**, the highest hourly price is forecasted at 11,4 cents between 8:00 and 10:00. Similarly, **Saturday** and **Sunday** may experience isolated hours with higher prices, even though their daily average prices remain low. Sunday is a public holiday, which can reduce electricity demand slightly and maintain the daily average price at a modest 2,6 cents, although prices may briefly rise up to nearly ten cents during evening hours.

Wednesday and Thursday will remain consistently affordable without significant price variations or risk of price spikes. On Thursday, there will be abundant wind power available, averaging almost 3,400 MW, which contributes to the low average price for the day.
