The Olkiluoto 2 nuclear power plant is currently undergoing maintenance. The maintenance break began on May 25, 2025, at 18:00, and is estimated to end on June 25, 2025, at 18:00. The maintenance may affect forecast accuracy, as training data during maintenance periods is limited.

In the coming week, average electricity prices will mostly remain affordable, varying daily from slightly negative to a few cents per kilowatt-hour. However, within individual days, considerable price fluctuations will occasionally occur. Particularly on **Friday** and **Saturday**, there is a risk of isolated price spikes.

The highest price peak of the week will occur on **Saturday**, when electricity prices are expected to reach up to 8.6 cents per kilowatt-hour. This peak will likely occur in the morning between 7:00 and 9:00. On Saturday, wind power production will occasionally drop to very low levels, partially explaining the risk of price spikes.

Similarly, on **Friday** morning between 7:00 and 9:00, prices are anticipated to rise significantly, reaching as high as 8.4 cents per kilowatt-hour. Friday's price fluctuations are partly due to exceptionally low minimum wind power output, only 589 megawatts. Additionally, Friday is a public holiday, potentially reducing energy demand and influencing price formation.

The week's cheapest hours and lowest average price will fall on **Sunday**, when the daily average price will turn negative at -0.3 cents per kilowatt-hour. Sunday will feature several hours when electricity is expected to be free or negatively priced. The lowest price, -1.2 Â¢/kWh, will occur late morning between 10:00 and 12:00, as well as in the afternoon between 13:00 and 15:00 and again between 16:00 and 18:00.

On Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday, prices will remain moderate, with no significant price increases anticipated. During these days, the electricity price will mostly range between one and three cents per kilowatt-hour. However, on Wednesday there is a slight risk of isolated price peaks, with prices potentially briefly rising to four cents between 9:00 and 11:00.
