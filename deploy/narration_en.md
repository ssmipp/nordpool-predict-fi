Olkiluoto 2 nuclear power plant is currently undergoing maintenance. The outage started on 25.5.2025 at 18:00 and is expected to end on 15.6.2025 at 18:00. The maintenance outage may affect the accuracy of the forecast, as training data during maintenance periods is limited.

Electricity prices will remain predominantly very low during the coming week. However, there will be some variation between days. Over the weekend and on Monday, the average electricity price is expected to be extremely low, and even negative on Sunday and Monday. Negative prices may occur especially during nighttime and midday hours, when electricity consumption is low and wind power generation is high.

On **Tuesday**, the price level will rise slightly compared to early in the week, with an average daily price of 1.6 cents per kilowatt-hour. The highest price peak (3.5 cents) on Tuesday will occur in the morning between 7:00 and 9:00, when wind power generation reaches its lowest point of the week. This lower wind power availability will locally raise prices during the morning consumption peak.

**Wednesday** and **Thursday** will experience the highest hourly prices of the week. On Wednesday, prices are forecasted to peak at 5.9 cents, occurring in the morning hours between 8:00 and 10:00. A similar situation, slightly intensified, will occur on Thursday, when the maximum price is expected to reach as high as 7.2 cents, again between 8:00 and 10:00 in the morning. These higher prices during these days can be partly explained by relatively low wind power generation coinciding with the morning consumption peaks.

On **Friday**, the price level will remain similar to Thursday, with an average daily price of 1.8 cents. Friday's maximum price (5.7 ¢) will again be observed in the morning hours, between 7:00 and 9:00.

Overall, the electricity price level for the week will remain very affordable, despite occasional higher-priced hours occurring almost daily. Consumers should pay particular attention to the inexpensive hours over the weekend and on Monday, when prices will be lowest and frequently negative for several hours each day.
