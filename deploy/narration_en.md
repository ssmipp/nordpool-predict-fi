Electricity price forecasts for the coming week will mainly remain at affordable levels. However, there will be significant differences between days. The week's lowest prices are expected on **Monday** and **Sunday**, when the average electricity price will remain clearly below one cent. Negative hourly prices below zero are predicted for both days, especially during early morning and afternoon hours. On Monday, between 04:00-06:00, prices may fall as low as -1,7 cents.

**Tuesday** stands out with clearly higher prices compared to the rest of the week. Tuesday's average price will rise close to three cents per kilowatt-hour, with notably high prices forecasted for the period between 08:00-10:00. Tuesday's peak price will occur at 08:00, when electricity prices may rise as high as 10,7 cents. At the same time, wind power production will be very low, just below 200 megawatts, explaining Tuesday's high peak price risk.

The risk of elevated prices continues on **Wednesday**, **Thursday**, **Friday**, and **Saturday**. On these days, individual peak hours may momentarily raise prices significantly above the daily average. Still, Wednesday's and Saturday's peaks should remain moderate, slightly above two cents. Price fluctuations will be more significant on Thursday and Friday: Thursday's maximum price will slightly exceed four cents, and on Friday it will approach eight cents. Friday's highest prices will occur during morning hours between 08:00-10:00.

Wind power production will fluctuate significantly during the week. Particularly on Tuesday and Friday, average wind power output will be relatively weak, partly contributing to higher peak prices on these days.

Overall, the week's outlook remains favorable, as the average electricity price will clearly stay below two cents per kilowatt-hour on most days. The risk of price spikes only concerns individual hours rather than entire days.
