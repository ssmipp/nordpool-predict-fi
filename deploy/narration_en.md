In the coming week, electricity spot prices will remain affordable on average. However, there will be some variation between days. The early days of the week will be particularly inexpensive, while prices will rise slightly towards the end of the week.

On **Monday** and **Tuesday**, average electricity prices will hover near zero, and at night, prices will even fall slightly into negative territory. Monday's lowest price will occur between 2:00 and 4:00 in the early morning hours, dropping as low as one cent below zero. On Tuesday afternoon, a similar situation will be seen between 13:00 and 15:00. Wednesday's prices will remain low overall, but a slight increase to 3,7 cents will occur around 8:00 in the morning.

On **Thursday**, a public holiday will be observed, which may reduce electricity demand and help moderate prices. Nevertheless, the day's average price will rise slightly above one cent, with peak prices occurring in the evening between approximately 18:00 and 20:00, when electricity will cost nearly five cents per kilowatt-hour.

On **Friday**, prices will reach the highest levels of the week, averaging nearly three cents. The day's highest price, 8,9 cents, will occur in the morning between 8:00 and 10:00. This price spike may partly result from relatively low wind power production, which will fall below 1500 megawatts at its lowest point.

During the weekend, prices will clearly decline again. On **Saturday** and **Sunday**, the average electricity price will remain very low, even slightly negative on Sunday. During these days, electricity prices will occasionally drop to nearly two cents below zero, especially on Sunday afternoon between 14:00 and 16:00.
