*Electricity prices in the coming week will vary considerably from day to day: early in the week, prices will even drop into negative territory at times, but by Friday, prices will climb to the week's highest levels. Fluctuations in wind power largely explain these differences, while Thursday's public holiday could also influence price levels.*

Olkiluoto 2 nuclear power plant is undergoing a maintenance outage. The outage started on 25 May 2025 at 18:00 and is expected to end on 15 June 2025 at 18:00. This maintenance outage may affect the accuracy of the price forecast, as training data during maintenance periods is limited.

Electricity prices will vary notably during the upcoming week, with significant fluctuations between different days. The price range will be broad, including negative prices. The highest prices of the week will occur on **Friday**, when the day's average price climbs to nearly three cents per kilowatt-hour. The most expensive single hour will be on Friday morning between 8:00 and 10:00, reaching 8.5 cents.

Early in the week, prices will remain very affordable overall. On **Monday** and **Tuesday**, average daily prices will hover around zero, and negative prices will appear particularly during Tuesday's night and afternoon hours. The week's lowest hourly price, -1.4 ¬¢, will occur overnight between 1:00 and 3:00 leading into **Wednesday**.

**Thursday** stands out with a higher average price (1.8 ¬¢) and also due to it being a public holiday. Because of the holiday, electricity demand is expected to be lower than usual, possibly keeping prices moderate. Still, there will be a risk of individual price peaks on Thursday evening, especially between 20:00 and 22:00, when prices will exceed four cents.

At the end of the week, price fluctuations will continue. On **Saturday**, prices will once again drop to very low levels, with an average price of only 0.4 cents. However, some individual hourly prices will be relatively high, peaking at 3.4 cents between 18:00 and 20:00. On **Sunday**, prices will remain very low throughout the day, and negative prices will be possible especially in the afternoon.

Wind power production will strongly influence electricity prices during the upcoming week. On windy days such as Monday and Tuesday, abundant wind power supply will push prices down. On Thursday and Friday, wind power generation will be lower than average, partly explaining these days' higher maximum prices.
