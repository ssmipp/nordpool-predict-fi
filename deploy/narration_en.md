*In the coming week, electricity spot prices will fluctuate notably: on cheaper days, prices will dip even into negative territory, but Sunday and Thursday evenings will experience temporary price peaks around ten cents due to weakened wind power production.*

There is an ongoing maintenance outage at the Olkiluoto 2 nuclear power plant, which began on 25 May 2025 at 18:00 and is expected to end on 23 June 2025 at 18:00. The maintenance outage may affect forecast accuracy, as training data from outage periods is limited.

During the coming week, electricity spot prices will show considerable variation. Generally, the week's average prices will remain affordable, but individual days will be characterized by higher price levels.

The week's highest price peak will occur on **Sunday**, when hourly electricity prices may rise close to 15 cents between 7:00 and 9:00 in the morning. At the same time, wind power production will be extremely low, dropping even below 300 MW. Sunday's average price will be just above five cents per kilowatt-hour.

On **Monday** and **Friday**, electricity prices will remain low throughout the day. On Monday, the average price will be just slightly over one cent, and maximum hourly prices will remain below three cents. Friday will also have an affordable average price, comfortably below two cents, and the maximum price will not exceed 3,3 cents.

On **Tuesday**, prices will fluctuate more significantly within the day, but the average price will still remain below four cents. Tuesday's highest price period will occur in the evening between 19:00 and 21:00, when prices may exceed ten cents. During that time, wind power production will be declining toward its daily low.

The average prices on Wednesday and Thursday will settle slightly above five cents. On both days, prices will reach their highest levels in the evening; on Thursday between 19:00 and 21:00, electricity prices may climb slightly above ten cents. On these days, wind power production will remain relatively low on average, partly explaining the higher peak prices.

On **Saturday**, electricity prices will fall to the week's lowest levels, occasionally even turning negative. During Saturday, the lowest price may reach as low as -1,0 cents during early-morning hours, and the day's average price will remain around half a cent. This will be due to ample wind power production throughout the day.
