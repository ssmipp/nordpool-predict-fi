The price outlook for the upcoming week will vary significantly from day to day. The greatest fluctuations will occur on **Monday** and **Tuesday**, with the average electricity price settling around six cents per kilowatt-hour. Both days carry a risk of price spikes, and hourly prices could rise above 18 cents. Especially on **Monday** around 9:00 in the morning, and similarly on **Tuesday** at 9:00, prices are expected to reach their highest points. These price variations and high peak prices can be partly explained by the temporarily very low output of wind power.

On **Wednesday**, price levels will remain somewhat higher than normal, with an average price just below five cents. The risk of price spikes will persist, but the day's highest price will fall clearly below the early week's maximums, staying under 12 cents per kilowatt-hour.

Towards the end of the week, electricity prices will drop significantly. On **Thursday** and **Friday**, daily average prices will be very affordable, remaining below one cent. No price spikes are anticipated, and prices will remain steadily low. At their lowest, prices may even become negative, particularly during the early morning hours.

The favorable pricing situation will continue into the weekend. On **Saturday**, electricity's average price will remain very low, approximately 0.3 cents. Negative prices will also be possible during midday and early afternoon hours. On the week's final day, **Sunday**, the range of electricity prices will be broad, from a negative low of -2.3 cents to nearly four cents in the evening. Nonetheless, the day is expected to remain affordable on average.

In summary, next week's electricity price expectations will vary considerably. The most expensive hours will occur around nine o'clock in the morning on Monday and Tuesday, while the cheapest electricity will be available on Thursday and through the weekend.
