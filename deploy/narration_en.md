During the upcoming week, hourly electricity prices will vary considerably depending on the day and time. Weekly price ranges will stretch from Sunday's negative -1,1 cents to Friday's highest peak of 16 cents. Generally, the most expensive price periods will occur in the morning and early evening hours.

On **Thursday** and **Friday**, price volatility will be particularly pronounced. Both days will carry a high risk of single-hour price spikes. On Thursday, the peak price will occur between 8:00 and 10:00 in the morning, potentially exceeding 15 cents per kilowatt-hour. Similarly, on Friday, a price spike of up to 16 cents is expected during the same morning hours between 8:00 and 10:00.

Over the weekend, however, the situation will clearly change. On **Saturday** and **Sunday**, prices will mostly remain around zero or even turn negative. Sunday's average price will be the lowest of the week, at -0,4 cents, and both days will offer opportunities for consumers to take advantage of low-cost periods. Due to negative prices, consumers may benefit economically from using electricity during these cheapest hours.

At the beginning of next week, prices will rise slightly again. On **Monday** and **Wednesday**, prices will vary moderately, reaching a maximum slightly above eight cents early Monday morning between 8:00 and 10:00. On **Tuesday**, electricity prices will remain affordable throughout the day, though there will still be a risk of isolated price spikes.

Throughout this week, daily average prices will differ significantly, with the weekend and early week clearly standing apart from Thursday's and Friday's high peaks. Electricity users are advised to stay informed of these fluctuations and monitor the situation daily.
