Olkiluoto 2 nuclear power plant is currently undergoing maintenance. The maintenance started on 25 May 2025 at 18:00 and is expected to end on 23 June 2025 at 18:00. This maintenance outage may affect forecast accuracy, as limited training data is available for such periods.

Electricity prices for the upcoming week will be variable. Noticeable differences exist between days, both in terms of average price and maximum hourly rates. The weekend will begin affordably, especially on **Saturday**, when the average electricity price will remain clearly below one cent, averaging just 0.4 cents. Exceptionally low and even negative prices are expected on Saturday afternoon, particularly between 13:00–15:00. The lowest hourly price will be on Saturday at 14:00, when the electricity price is forecasted at -1.3 cents.

The situation will quickly change on **Sunday**, as the average electricity price rises to the weekend's highest level, around five cents. Sunday will feature clear price peaks during certain hours. Between 7:00–9:00 in the morning, prices will rise above nine cents, reaching a peak at 8:00 with a price of 13.1 cents per kilowatt-hour. Sunday's high prices are associated with low wind power generation, at a minimum only 294 megawatts.

At the start of the week, prices will again become more moderate. On **Monday**, electricity prices will average below two cents, though there is still a risk of occasional price spikes. On Tuesday and Wednesday, average prices will rise slightly, with Tuesday's average at 4.4 cents and Wednesday slightly below four cents. On Tuesday, the highest prices will occur during evening hours between 19:00–21:00, nearing nine cents. Wednesday will be slightly more stable, although the price will still exceed five cents at its highest.

Later in the week, on **Thursday**, the average electricity price will reach its weekly peak at 5.3 cents. High hourly prices exceeding nine cents are expected Thursday evening between 18:00–20:00. On Friday, the average price will slightly decrease again, settling around four cents on average, without notable peaks.

Thus, the week's price development will be characterized by clear fluctuations, especially marked by price spikes during the weekend and midweek. Consumers should particularly note Sunday morning and Thursday evening hours due to elevated prices.
