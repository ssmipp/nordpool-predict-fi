*Electricity prices will remain moderate over the coming days: during the weekend, prices will occasionally dip into negative territory due to abundant wind power production, while early next week, higher hourly prices are expected during morning hours, peaking at up to 10 cents per kilowatt-hour.*

There is currently a maintenance outage at the Olkiluoto 2 nuclear power plant. The maintenance began on 25 May 2025 at 18:00 and is expected to continue until 15 June 2025 at 18:00. Due to this maintenance outage, the accuracy of the price forecast may be slightly reduced, as there is limited training data available from periods with nuclear plant outages.

Forecast updated on Thursday at 21:05.

Electricity prices will remain at moderate levels over the coming days. Price forecasts throughout the week are generally favorable, with daily average prices varying from negative figures up to just over four cents per kilowatt-hour.

The weekend will begin with negative average price forecasts. On **Saturday**, the expected daily average price is -0.4 cents, and the lowest expected hourly price may reach as low as -1.8 cents per kWh. Negative prices will continue on **Sunday**, when the day's lowest price is forecasted to drop to -2.2 cents. Sunday is also a public holiday, which could further reduce electricity demand and push prices even lower, particularly during morning and afternoon hours.

The week's highest average daily price, 4.4 cents per kWh, is forecasted for **Monday**. Monday is also expected to see the week's highest single-hour price, potentially reaching up to 10 cents per kilowatt-hour. This peak price will likely occur in the morning hours between 8:00 and 10:00.

On **Tuesday** and **Wednesday**, prices are also expected to rise at certain times. On Tuesday, the maximum price could reach 7.6 cents per kWh during the morning hours between 8:00 and 10:00. Wednesday's peak price, at 5.9 cents, will similarly occur during the same morning timeframe.

By **Thursday**, price volatility is expected to decrease again. The predicted daily average price is 1.0 cents, with modest hourly variations, peaking at 2.4 cents per kWh.

Notably, wind power production will be high during the weekend. On Saturday and Sunday, wind power generation will exceed 3500 MW for several hours, largely explaining the exceptionally low prices for these days. On Monday, however, wind power production will drop significantly, averaging only 1584 MW, partly explaining the day's higher price level.
