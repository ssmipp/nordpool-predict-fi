Electricity prices will fluctuate considerably from day to day during the upcoming week. Over the weekend, electricity prices will remain very low. On **Saturday**, the average price will stay near zero, with some of the cheapest hours even dipping slightly below zero. On **Sunday**, average prices will also be low, but there will be significant variation throughout the day: during the early morning hours and between 13:00–15:00 in the afternoon, prices will turn negative, reaching as low as -1,9 cents. However, in the evening between 18:00–20:00, prices will rise notably, peaking at 4,4 cents.

The most expensive day of the week will be **Monday**. Average prices on Monday will rise to 5,8 cents, accompanied by substantial intraday price fluctuations. The highest price of the week, 17,5 cents, will occur on Monday morning between 8:00–10:00. This peak will be driven especially by low wind power production, as wind generation drops to only 364 MW at its lowest point during the day. Due to the weak wind situation on Monday, there is also a high risk of short-term price spikes, potentially exceeding the forecasted peak.

On **Tuesday** and **Wednesday**, prices will decrease slightly compared to Monday, but both days will still maintain average prices above four cents. These days also carry a risk of short-term price spikes. On Tuesday evening between 19:00–21:00, electricity prices will climb above 10 cents at their highest. On Wednesday, the highest price, 10,8 cents, will occur in the morning between 8:00–10:00.

Towards the end of the week, electricity prices will decrease further. On **Thursday**, average prices will settle below three cents, with no price spikes expected. On **Friday**, average prices will remain slightly higher than on Thursday, averaging 3,5 cents. Friday will see some price variation, with prices close to zero in the early morning hours but rising to over nine cents in the evening between 20:00–22:00.
