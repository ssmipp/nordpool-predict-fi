In the coming week, electricity spot prices will vary significantly from day to day. However, average price levels will remain quite affordable, mostly below five cents. Clearly the most expensive days will be **Thursday** and **Friday**, when daily average prices will rise above four cents. Among these, Friday's average price is expected to be the highest of the week, approximately 4.7 cents, with maximum hourly rates potentially exceeding 12 cents. Friday also carries an elevated risk of price spikes, especially in the morning from around 8:00 to 10:00, when hourly prices may rise above 11 cents.

The price level will decrease significantly by the weekend. On **Saturday**, the average daily price will be just slightly over one cent, and on Sunday, electricity prices are even expected to turn negative on average, around minus half a cent. Throughout Sunday, the price of electricity will remain very low, fluctuating between -1.3 and 0.0 cents. Negative prices theoretically mean that electricity consumers could be compensated for using electricity during these hours.

**Monday** and **Tuesday** will also be very affordable days, with prices mostly staying near zero or slightly above. The average daily prices for these days are around one cent. The Tuesday forecast does not mention any risk of price spikes.

On **Wednesday**, prices will remain affordable, but hourly rates could fluctuate notably within the day. The daily average price will be around one cent, but during individual hours the price might rise above five cents. Wednesday carries a noted risk of occasional hourly price spikes.

Wind power production will vary during the week, affecting pricing particularly on the weekend. On Saturday and Sunday, periods of strong wind power production will contribute to low prices. Conversely, on Friday, minimum wind power production will be very low, only 339 megawatts, partly explaining higher hourly peaks on that day.
