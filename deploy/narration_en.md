The Olkiluoto 2 nuclear power plant is currently undergoing maintenance. The outage started on 25.5.2025 at 18:00 and its estimated completion is on 21.6.2025 at 18:00. This maintenance outage may affect forecast accuracy, as training data during outage periods is limited.

Electricity spot prices will show considerable variation in the coming days. Prices are expected to remain affordable or normal, but the week's highest maximum prices will clearly occur on **Friday**. Friday's most expensive hours will be in the evening between 19:00 and 21:00, when prices could exceed 17 cents per kilowatt-hour. During early Friday morning, between 03:00 and 05:00, prices could fall into negative territory, even down to -0.3 cents.

On **Saturday**, the average electricity price will be very low, just 0.3 cents, and there will be several hours of negative prices throughout the day. The cheapest hour will occur in the afternoon between 13:00 and 15:00, reaching as low as -1.7 Â¢. This makes Saturday the week's most affordable day for electricity users.

On **Sunday**, prices will slightly rebound but will still remain affordable. Sunday's highest price, 7.6 Â¢, will occur in the evening between 19:00 and 21:00, while prices in the early morning hours will hover around zero or slightly below. On **Monday**, prices will increase further, with the day's average price expected to be just under five cents. Evening hours between 19:00 and 21:00 could see prices rise above 11 cents.

Midweek, prices will decrease again. On **Tuesday**, **Wednesday**, and **Thursday**, average electricity prices will remain moderate, with negative hours occurring only occasionally. Among these days, Wednesday is expected to be the cheapest, with the lowest price hour between 03:00 and 05:00 in the early morning, again negative at -0.5 Â¢.

As maintenance at Olkiluoto 2 will continue past the period covered by this forecast, price predictions may carry some uncertainty, particularly in longer-term forecasts. Users should prepare for the possibility that prices during certain hours could rise higher than forecasted, especially on Friday and Saturday, when the risk of price spikes is high.
