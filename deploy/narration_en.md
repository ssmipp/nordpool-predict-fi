*In the coming week, market electricity prices will vary significantly day by day: the week will begin with higher prices and potential peak price hours, while prices will clearly drop in the latter half of the week, including negative hourly prices due to lower demand during public holidays.*

The Olkiluoto 2 nuclear power plant is currently undergoing a maintenance outage that began on 25.5.2025 at 18:00 and is expected to end on 21.6.2025 at 18:00. This maintenance outage may affect the accuracy of the price forecast, as there is limited training data available from periods during outages.

During the coming week, electricity prices will show considerable daily variation. At the beginning of the week, prices will rise higher than towards the end, and there will also be negative price hours during the week.

The most expensive day of the week will be **Monday**, when the average price will climb to 4.7 cents, and certain hourly prices may rise above 12 ¬¢. Particularly on Monday evening, between 18:00‚Äì20:00, the highest prices are expected, with electricity prices possibly exceeding 12 cents. **Tuesday** will also see high hourly prices during the morning between 08:00‚Äì10:00, when prices will reach over 13 cents. Both Monday and Tuesday carry risks of price spikes on individual hours.

The most affordable days of the week will be **Thursday**, **Friday**, and **Saturday**, when the daily average price stays below two cents. These days will also see negative hourly prices. Particularly on Saturday afternoon, between 12:00‚Äì16:00, electricity prices will dip significantly negative, bottoming out at -2.6 cents.

Friday and Saturday are public holidays, during which electricity demand may be lower than typical weekdays. This may partly explain these days' lower price levels.

Significant fluctuations in wind power production will also be observed during the week, which could impact the highest maximum prices momentarily. Monday‚Äôs higher prices may partly be explained by low wind power production, with minimum generation at just 870 MW. Similarly, Tuesday‚Äôs highest prices will coincide with low wind power output.
