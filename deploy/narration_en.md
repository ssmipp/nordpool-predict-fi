The Olkiluoto 2 nuclear power plant is currently undergoing maintenance. The plant has a nominal capacity of 890.0 MW, and its availability is currently at 0%. The maintenance outage began on 25.5.2025 at 18:00, and it is scheduled to end on 25.6.2025 at 18:00. This maintenance outage may affect the accuracy of the forecast, as training data from periods of maintenance outages is limited.

The electricity price forecast for the coming week shows clear daily variations. The most affordable days will be **Thursday** and **Friday**, when average electricity prices remain around one cent per kilowatt-hour. Thursday will see the lowest single hourly price of the week, at -0.7 cents, occurring during night hours between 2:00–4:00. Electricity will also briefly dip into negative pricing (-0.5 ¢) early Friday morning at 4:00.

**Wednesday** will differ markedly from other days due to its highest single-hour price. The day's peak pricing will occur in the morning between 8:00–10:00, when prices could rise as high as 13.6 cents. Nevertheless, Wednesday's average price will remain moderate at approximately 3.0 cents.

During the weekend, **Saturday** will be slightly more expensive, with average prices rising to 3.2 cents. On Saturday evening between 19:00–21:00, hourly prices will peak at over 9 cents. Sunday's prices will remain somewhat lower, averaging 2.3 ¢.

At the start of next week, prices will remain relatively stable. **Monday** will have an average price of 2.8 cents, and **Tuesday** will see an average of 2.9 cents. However, on Tuesday evening between 21:00–23:00, prices will rise significantly, peaking above 7 cents.

Several days carry a noted risk of price spikes during certain individual hours. This applies particularly to the forecasts for Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday, Monday, and Tuesday. This indicates that during specific hours, actual prices might rise above the forecasted maximum.
