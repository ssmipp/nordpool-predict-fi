*The electricity price forecast for the coming days shows significant fluctuations: during the cheapest moments of the week, electricity prices will dip into negative territory, while the highest prices will occur during weekend mornings and evenings, when low wind power production increases the risk of price spikes.*

The Olkiluoto 2 nuclear power plant is currently undergoing maintenance. The outage began on 25.5.2025 at 18:00 and is expected to end on 25.6.2025 at 18:00. The maintenance outage may affect the accuracy of the price forecast, as historical training data from outage periods is limited.

The forecast was last updated on Wednesday at 14:24.

The upcoming week's electricity prices will vary considerably between days. Price developments will range from negatively priced low-cost hours to peaks approaching nearly 12 cents per kilowatt-hour. The most expensive hours of the week will occur on **Saturday** morning, approximately between 7:00 and 9:00, when electricity prices could rise up to 11,4 cents per kilowatt-hour.

On **Friday** morning and evening, electricity price levels will also rise significantly compared to other days. Peak prices will be observed roughly between 19:00 and 21:00, potentially reaching up to 9,5 cents. The risk of price spikes will also exist on Sunday, Tuesday, and Wednesday, although the maximum prices on these days will remain notably lower compared to Friday and Saturday.

The cheapest day of the week in terms of average price will be **Sunday**, where the average price is forecasted to drop below zero to -0,4 cents. This means that electricity prices on Sunday are expected to be negative for several hours. Negative prices are also possible on Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Monday, and Wednesday, particularly during overnight and early morning hours.

Wind power production will drop clearly on Friday and Saturday, and the low minimum wind power generation on these days partly explains the higher maximum prices. On Friday, wind power generation will reach a minimum of 553 MW, while on Saturday it will drop as low as 433 MW. On other days, wind power availability will be significantly higher and will not notably influence prices.

Daily average temperatures throughout the week will remain fairly stable, slightly above 12 degrees Celsius. Temperature will have no significant impact on electricity price developments in the coming days. At the beginning of the week, Monday and Tuesday, electricity prices will return to moderate and near-normal levels, without significant price spikes.
