During the upcoming week, electricity prices on the power exchange will vary noticeably between days. Prices will generally remain affordable, however. The week's highest prices will occur on **Monday**, when the daily average climbs to 5,5 cents, and the peak price reaches 14,5 cents. The risk for price spikes on Monday will be significant, especially in the evening around 18:00â€“20:00, when price levels are expected to be highest.

The most affordable days of the week will be **Thursday**, **Friday**, and **Saturday**, when prices will mostly remain well below two cents. On Thursday and Friday, negative hourly prices will also occur, meaning electricity prices will drop below zero. On Saturday, the week's lowest price will be recorded, as low as -2,1 Â¢ at night.

On **Sunday**, **Tuesday**, and **Wednesday**, prices will remain moderate on average, although intra-day price variations will be large. On these days, maximum prices will momentarily rise above 7â€“10 cents, especially during morning and evening hours. Hence, there will be a risk for price spikes on these days as well, but they will remain significantly lower compared to Monday.

Friday and Saturday will be public holidays, reducing electricity demand and consequently lowering prices. This effect will be particularly noticeable in Saturday's very low price levels.

The week's lowest prices will mainly occur during nighttime and early morning hours when electricity consumption is minimal. The morning and evening hours on weekdays will consistently be somewhat pricier.
