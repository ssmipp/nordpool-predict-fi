Electricity prices will vary significantly day-to-day in the coming week. The week will begin with relatively high prices, but prices will notably drop towards the end of the week.

On **Monday**, the average electricity price is expected to rise to 5,9 cents per kilowatt-hour. Prices may momentarily reach as high as 17,8 cents. There is a high risk of price spikes especially in the morning between 7:00 and 9:00, when the forecasted price is highest. At the same time, the forecasted minimum wind power output is very low, just 377 MW, contributing to these elevated prices.

**Tuesday's** average price will also be high at 5,6 cents per kilowatt-hour, with a maximum price potentially rising to 17,3 cents. The risk of price spikes on Tuesday is again particularly high in the morning hours between 7:00 and 9:00. Tuesday's minimum wind power output is similarly low at 474 MW, partially explaining the elevated maximum price.

Prices will settle slightly on **Wednesday**, but the day's average price will remain relatively high at 4,6 cents. Wednesday's maximum price will be somewhat lower at 12,0 cents, yet there remains a risk of price spikes on individual hours especially during the morning.

Towards the end of the week, prices will decline markedly. The average price on **Thursday** is forecasted to be just 0,7 cents, with minimum prices dipping into negative territory at -0,3 cents. **Friday** and **Saturday** average prices will also remain extremely low, around one cent or below. Negative minimum prices will appear on both days, reaching as low as -0,6 ¢ on Friday and -1,1 ¢ on Saturday. On these days, electricity prices will remain very low throughout the entire day.

Throughout the week, price variations will be substantial, especially between the high prices of early week and the low prices at week's end. Consumers should pay particular attention to Monday and Tuesday mornings, when prices are forecasted to peak.
