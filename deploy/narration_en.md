Electricity prices for the upcoming week will clearly vary from day to day. The most affordable day will be **Thursday**, when the average price will remain around 0.1 cents, and the lowest price will even dip negative at -0.3 cents. The highest price moments will occur during the weekend, particularly on **Saturday**, when price variations will be the largest. On Saturday, the average price will rise to 2.5 cents and peak prices will reach over 10 cents during the morning hours (between 7–9).

On **Friday**, prices will also climb significantly higher than on other days of the week. During the morning (7–9) and evening (19–21) hours, prices will rise above 7 cents, peaking at up to 8.6 cents. The high price moments on Friday and Saturday can be partly explained by low wind power production, which at times may drop even below 500 megawatts. Both these days also carry an increased risk of price spikes during individual hours.

After the weekend, prices will again decrease noticeably. On **Sunday**, price expectations will remain low, with an average price of only 0.3 cents and prices becoming negative again in the afternoon. On Monday and Tuesday, the price level will rise slightly but will remain moderate, averaging between 1–2 cents.

Next **Wednesday**, prices are expected to remain stable, with an average price of 1.4 cents. Wind power production will vary throughout the week, with particularly high production early in the week helping to keep prices low.
