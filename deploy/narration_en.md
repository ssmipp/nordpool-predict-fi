Next week's electricity price forecasts show considerable variation between days. Prices will be inexpensive on average, though certain days clearly stand out due to noticeable price fluctuations. Particularly, **Thursday** will distinguish itself with the week's highest expected average price of 5.3 cents per kilowatt-hour and a maximum hourly price of 9.6 ¬¢. Thursday's price fluctuations are likely explained by low wind power production, which is at its lowest weekly average level (1622 MW).

The week will start calmly. The average prices on **Monday** and **Tuesday** remain modest, although Tuesday will occasionally feature high hourly prices. On **Tuesday**, the most expensive hours will occur in the evening between 19:00 and 21:00, with forecasted prices surpassing nine cents. Monday may also experience isolated price spikes, although the day's overall price level remains low.

From Wednesday onward, prices will rise slightly. The average price on **Wednesday** settles at 4.1 cents, with fewer significant hourly fluctuations compared to Thursday. On **Thursday**, the highest prices will again occur during evening hours between 19:00 and 21:00, when electricity prices approach the ten-cent threshold. Low wind power production on these days contributes notably to these price differences.

The week will conclude with lower prices again. On **Friday** and **Saturday**, negative hourly prices will even occur, indicating abundant electricity production relative to demand. On Friday afternoon between 12:00 and 14:00, prices will drop below zero, and similarly, Saturday morning between 9:00 and 12:00, electricity prices will reach their lowest at -1.0 cents.

Overall, next week's electricity prices will remain inexpensive on average, though individual days and hours could bring clear price variations. Electricity users should particularly note Thursday‚Äôs higher prices, as well as the notably affordable hours on Friday and Saturday.
