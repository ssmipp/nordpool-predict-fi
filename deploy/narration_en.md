*Electricity prices on the spot market will fluctuate notably in the coming week: early in the week, hourly prices will temporarily rise, while prices will decrease towards the weekend. Reduced demand during public holidays and occasional negative prices will make electricity particularly affordable over the weekend.*

In the coming week, electricity prices on the spot market will vary significantly between days. Prices will peak early in the week, but clearly decline towards the weekend. Throughout the week, average prices will nevertheless remain fairly affordable.

The highest prices of the week will occur clearly on **Monday**. The day's average price will settle at 4.6 cents, but momentarily prices may rise as high as 10.9 cents. The risk of price spikes will be particularly high during the morning hours, around 9‚Äì11 AM, when hourly prices could exceed ten cents. This is partly due to wind power production dropping below 700 MW precisely during the morning hours.

On **Tuesday** and **Wednesday**, there will also be a risk of hourly price increases at certain times. On Tuesday morning around 9 AM, the price may rise close to ten cents. Wednesday's highest price level will also occur in the morning, particularly between 9‚Äì10 AM, when prices could rise above five cents.

For Thursday, price expectations will be stable, and no significant fluctuations are expected. The day's average price will only be 0.6 cents per kWh, and the price range will be the narrowest of the entire week.

**Friday** and **Saturday** will exceptionally be public holidays, and electricity demand may thus be lower than average. This could help keep prices low. On Friday, the average electricity price will be around two cents, although prices could momentarily rise close to ten cents during the day. Saturday's average price will remain below two cents, even though the day's most expensive hour could rise close to six cents.

The week's cheapest moments will occur on **Sunday**, when the average electricity price stays at just 0.2 cents, and overnight prices will even be negative. Negative hourly prices will also occur momentarily on Thursday and during Saturday afternoon.
