**Sunday's** average price will remain slightly lower than Saturday's, but in the morning between 08:00 and 10:00, electricity prices will again be high, reaching up to 9.6 cents. Sunday also carries a risk of short-term price spikes during individual hours.

At the beginning of the week, on **Monday** and **Wednesday**, prices will remain very moderate.

Next **Thursday**, prices will fluctuate considerably during the day. Electricity prices will fall negative at their lowest in the morning between 05:00 and 07:00, but in the evening between 19:00 and 21:00, prices are forecasted to climb to the week's highest level of 9.4 cents.
