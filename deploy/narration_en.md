Electricity prices in the exchange market will show significant variations in the coming days, both between days and within single days. The cheapest day will be **Sunday**, when the average electricity price is expected to be negative (-0.5 ¢), dropping as low as -1.7 cents per kilowatt-hour. Sunday's negative prices will occur particularly in the afternoon, with the week's lowest rates expected between 15:00–17:00. However, Sunday also carries a risk of isolated price spikes, with the maximum price reaching 0.9 ¢ between 18:00–20:00.

On **Monday**, the average price will remain close to zero (-0.0 ¢), and the day's lowest price (-2.1 ¢) will occur in the early morning hours between 03:00–05:00. Overall, Monday's prices will remain at a very low level throughout the day, with no significant deviations expected.

Prices will begin to rise on **Tuesday**, with the daily average climbing to 1.5 cents. Tuesday's highest prices will appear in the evening between 19:00–21:00, peaking at 3.6 ¢. Wednesday's average price (1.2 ¢) will remain close to Tuesday's level, but the highest prices will be slightly above Tuesday, reaching 4.9 ¢ between 09:00–11:00. Both days carry a risk for isolated price spikes.

The highest price level of the week will occur on **Thursday**, when the average daily rate will rise to 2.2 cents and the peak price will reach as high as 7.0 cents during the morning hours of 08:00–10:00. Prices will remain relatively high on Friday as well, with an average price of 1.7 ¢ and the day's peak price of 6.0 cents occurring between 08:00–10:00. Both Thursday and Friday also carry a risk of isolated price spikes.

Saturday, on the other hand, will again provide cheaper electricity, with an average price of only 0.2 cents and negative prices during the day, down to -1.2 ¢ in the afternoon between 13:00–15:00. Thus, Saturday's price level remains moderate compared to the higher prices later in the week.
