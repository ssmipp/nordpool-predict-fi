Price forecasts for the coming days will show distinct fluctuations, although average prices will remain affordable. Early in the week will be especially inexpensive, as **Tuesday's** average price will dip negative to -0.2 cents. At its lowest, electricity will be priced as low as -1.2 cents on Tuesday during late morning and early afternoon hours. However, average prices are set to rise towards the end of the week, peaking next **Monday** and this **Friday**, both averaging around 3.1 cents.

The week's highest individual hourly prices will occur on **Friday** and next Monday. On Friday morning at 9:00, electricity prices will briefly rise to 11 cents. On next Monday morning between 8:00 and 10:00, the week's highest prices are expected, reaching between 10.4 and 12.2 cents.

**Thursday** is a public holiday, potentially reducing electricity demand and thus influencing prices. Nevertheless, Thursday's average price will remain moderate at 2.8 cents, although individual hours may surpass five cents during the morning.

Variations in wind power production will partially explain the differences in daily prices. Early in the week, wind power production will be high; on **Wednesday**, wind energy will be plentiful with an average exceeding 4000 megawatts. Conversely, **Thursday** and **Friday** will see significantly lower wind power production, partly explaining higher price levels and occasional price spikes on these days.

Hourly price fluctuations will be considerable throughout the week, yet average prices will remain very affordable overall. Especially early in the week, prices will stay notably low, even negative at times. Toward the weekend, morning hours will become more expensive, whereas nighttime and afternoon prices will remain moderate.
