The coming week's electricity price forecasts will vary significantly from day to day. However, average prices will mostly remain affordable, as nearly all days will have average prices below four cents.

The week's clearly most expensive day will be **Tuesday**, when the average price will rise to 5.3 cents. Price fluctuations during the day will be significant, with the lowest hourly price forecasted at only 0.2 cents, but the highest hour reaching 12.5 cents. The risk of price spikes will rise particularly in the morning between 7–9 and again in the evening between 19–21. Tuesday's exceptionally low minimum wind power production (just 524 MW) partly explains the day's high peak price.

Prices will drop significantly midweek. On **Wednesday** and **Thursday**, electricity will be inexpensive on average, and Thursday will even see negative prices during the night, down to -0.7 cents. Thursday's high wind power production (averaging over 3000 MW) supports the low electricity prices.

On **Friday**, the average price will rise slightly to 2.4 cents, and the risk of price spikes will increase on individual hours, particularly around eight in the morning, when prices could reach up to 6.7 cents. On Saturday and Sunday, prices will again remain low, with Sunday—a public holiday—expected to have lower-than-usual electricity demand. This will also be reflected in negative prices, reaching as low as -1.2 cents in the afternoon.

The week's price development will conclude next **Monday** with a higher average price of 4.0 cents, when the risk of price spikes will again exist, especially around nine in the morning.
