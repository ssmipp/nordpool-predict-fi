Electricity prices next week will remain predominantly low. However, noticeable differences between days are expected. The most affordable days will be **Saturday** and **Sunday**, with average prices hovering around zero or even negative. On Saturday, the lowest hourly price will drop to -1.2 cents between 13:00 and 15:00, while Sunday will see even lower prices, -1.4 cents from 15:00 to 17:00. Consumers can especially benefit from negative pricing during afternoon hours on both days.

**Friday** clearly stands out as the most expensive day of the week. The day's average price will rise to 1.9 cents, peaking notably between 7:00 and 9:00 in the morning at 6.7 cents—the week's highest single-hour price. Friday's price spikes are partly driven by low minimum wind power production, dropping momentarily below 1,000 MW.

Individual hour price spikes are also possible on **Tuesday** and **Wednesday**. On Tuesday, the highest price of 2.6 cents is expected in the morning hours between 8:00 and 10:00. Wednesday's peak is forecasted slightly lower at 2.2 cents, also occurring from 8:00 to 10:00. On both days, periods of relatively low wind power production partially explain these temporary price increases.

Mid-week days, **Monday** and **Thursday**, will see relatively stable price levels, with no significant fluctuations or peaks expected. On both days, the average electricity price will remain below half a cent, and wind power production will show no notable deviations affecting price.

After the weekend, electricity prices will gradually increase as the following weekend approaches. Apart from the anticipated higher prices on Friday, the week generally offers consumers affordable electricity rates.
